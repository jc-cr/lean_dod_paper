abstract = {Precast concrete components are increasingly used in construction. Since the inspection of their quality is important and involves a large workload, automated methods have been researched to improve the efficiency of inspection with sufficient accuracy. This paper presents a review of existing researches on the automated quality inspection of precast concrete components by using scientometric analysis and critical reviews. Firstly, three key research themes, namely, inspection of dimensional quality of components, inspection of surface quality of components, and improvements in data collection and analysis of inspection, are identified and described based on the result of scientometric analysis. Then, existing inspection methods are analyzed and compared through the critical reviews. Next, gaps between existing inspection methods and actual needs are summarized. Finally, future directions in this field are predicted accordingly. Overall, this paper contributes to future researches and applications for the quality inspection of precast concrete components.}
