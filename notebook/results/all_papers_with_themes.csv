MANAGE THE LOAD,"A foundational, universal approach for building a sustainable and agile acquisition workforce. Since ancient times, great militaries have needed to figure out how to effectively manage manpower in the face of ever-evolving technology. ASA(ALT) and the U.S. Army Manpower Analysis Agency provided guidance and a simplified spreadsheet to capture manpower, but we quickly realized the need to re-build the worksheet to cover all aspects of acquisition operations, including exploiting the Adaptive Acquisition Framework. At baseline, we were able to analyze programs by type (e.g., acquisition,investment or workload master lists); work by type (e.g., direct, indirect, unfunded); acquisition life cycle phase, product or deliverable by type; and performance by sub-organization and acquisition function (e.g., business, contracting, cybersecurity engineering, logistics, program management, test and evaluation, program and quality activities and production). When considering using this for an agile workforce objective, we kept the demand analysis focused under four years to capture execution and budget plus two years into the program objective memorandum planning phase.",3163934219,,,Trade Journals,,"Clark, Matthew;Kolen, Edwin",, Department of the Army, Copyright Superintendent of Documents Winter 2025,,, General Information,, Winter 2025,,,1529-8507,, English, English,, 20-25, Fort Belvoir,Winter 2025,Army AL & T,2025,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/manage-load/docview/3163934219/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amilitary&amp;atitle=MANAGE+THE+LOAD&amp;title=Army+AL+%26+T&amp;issn=15298507&amp;date=2025-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=20&amp;au=Clark%2C+Matthew%3BKolen%2C+Edwin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Army+AL+%26+T&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",foundational universal building sustainable agile acquisition workforce since ancient time great military needed figure effectively manage manpower face technology asa alt army manpower agency provided guidance simplified spreadsheet capture manpower quickly realized need worksheet cover aspect acquisition operation including exploiting adaptive acquisition framework baseline able analyze program type acquisition investment workload master list work type direct indirect unfunded acquisition life cycle phase product deliverable type performance acquisition function business contracting cybersecurity engineering logistics program management test evaluation program quality activity production considering using agile workforce objective kept demand focused four year capture execution budget plus two year program objective memorandum planning phase,"['foundational', 'universal', 'building', 'sustainable', 'agile', 'acquisition', 'workforce', 'since', 'ancient', 'times', 'great', 'militaries', 'needed', 'figure', 'effectively', 'manage', 'manpower', 'face', 'technology', 'asa', 'alt', 'army', 'manpower', 'agency', 'provided', 'guidance', 'simplified', 'spreadsheet', 'capture', 'manpower', 'quickly', 'realized', 'need', 'worksheet', 'cover', 'aspects', 'acquisition', 'operations', 'including', 'exploiting', 'adaptive', 'acquisition', 'framework', 'baseline', 'able', 'analyze', 'programs', 'type', 'acquisition', 'investment', 'workload', 'master', 'lists', 'work', 'type', 'direct', 'indirect', 'unfunded', 'acquisition', 'life', 'cycle', 'phase', 'product', 'deliverable', 'type', 'performance', 'acquisition', 'function', 'business', 'contracting', 'cybersecurity', 'engineering', 'logistics', 'program', 'management', 'test', 'evaluation', 'program', 'quality', 'activities', 'production', 'considering', 'using', 'agile', 'workforce', 'objective', 'kept', 'demand', 'focused', 'four', 'years', 'capture', 'execution', 'budget', 'plus', 'two', 'years', 'program', 'objective', 'memorandum', 'planning', 'phase']",General Information,2,Management and Leadership
Congressional Oversight of the Military Health System: Lessons Learned from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center Scandal,"Background: Congress has a constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight of the Military Health System (MHS), a federal health system administered by the Department of Defense (DOD). Congress also has a practical responsibility, akin to health care organization governing boards, to conduct oversight of the MHS. Over several decades, Congress has experienced high turnover and low tenure among its staff, resulting in a “congressional brain drain.” This brain drain has raised questions as to whether Congress has adequate expertise, training, and experience to effectively conduct its constitutional and practical responsibilities, like oversight of the MHS. One way to mitigate this brain drain is to ensure Congress has the resources to bridge the knowledge gap between experienced and inexperienced staffers. To inform the development of these resources, lessons learned from previous oversight cases can be assessed to identify best practices on conducting congressional oversight of the MHS. The aim of this study was to identify lessons learned from congressional oversight of the MHS in response to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) scandal between 2007 and 2009. To achieve this aim, the study had three objectives: (1) describe the motivating factors for Congress to initiate oversight of the MHS, (2) identify and describe the tools and techniques that Congress used to conduct oversight of the MHS, and (3) assess the perceived effectiveness of those oversight efforts. Methods: To achieve the aim and objectives of this study, a descriptive program-related case study design was used to investigate one purposively selected, information-oriented event case. The selected event case was the WRAMC scandal that came to light in February 2007 after a series of the Washington Post articles describing unsatisfactory housing conditions and patient neglect of wounded, ill, and injured service members, and overall mismanagement of medical and medical support programs at WRAMC and other military hospitals. This scandal captured the attention of Congress, which convened a series of oversight hearings and conducted fact-finding activities to investigate these allegations. Congressional oversight efforts lasted over two years and resulted in significant changes to the MHS and to DOD’s wounded warrior policies and programs. This study had three research questions: (RQ1) Why did Congress conduct oversight of the MHS? (RQ2) What tools or techniques did Congress use to conduct oversight of the MHS? (RQ3) Was Congress’s oversight of the MHS perceived as effective? Data was collected from a total of 23 key informant interviews and 20 documents reviewed across three stakeholder categories: legislative branch, executive branch, and spectators (i.e., varied stakeholders). Data was examined using a narrative analysis and application of the Levin-Bean Measures of Oversight Effectiveness, which assessed stakeholder perspectives on the quality of the investigation, bipartisanship, credibility, and policy impact of Congress’s oversight activities. Results: For RQ1, stakeholders described Congress’s motivation to conduct oversight on the MHS as emanating from the institution’s duty to act when something goes awry in the executive branch, as a responsibility to address or remediate issues relating specifically to the military, and for performative effects. For RQ2, stakeholders described Congress’s use of 36 different oversight tools and techniques to collect and document facts, identify and implement solutions, and hold DOD leaders accountable for the scandal. For RQ3, stakeholders described 11 broad themes that were mostly positive perspectives in each of the Levin-Bean Measures of Oversight Effectiveness and suggests that Congress’s oversight of the MHS in response to the WRAMC scandal was viewed as effective. Conclusion: This case study identified motivational factors, tools, and techniques that Congress used to conduct oversight of the MHS in response to the WRAMC scandal. This study also found that stakeholders generally viewed Congress’s oversight actions as being effective, in part, because they involved high-quality probes, appeared bipartisan in nature, were conducted in a credible manner, and produced meaningful policy and program changes. While addressing the study’s research objectives, 14 distinct oversight lessons learned also emerged from the dataset. The lessons derived from multiple stakeholder perspectives were subsequently translated into an applied practice product and tailored for congressional staffers as a resource that offers 12 best practices for conducting oversight of the MHS. Predicting when the next scandal in the MHS will occur is nearly impossible, but Congress must be ready to fulfill its oversight responsibilities. To perform these responsibilities, it is essential for Congress to have experienced and informed staffers. When there is a gap in experience or knowledge, congressional staff need relevant and useful tools and resources to help guide oversight planning and endeavors. This study’s best practices resource seeks to provide that support for congressional staffers to understand the role of Congress, the dynamics of the institution, and the art of oversight of the MHS.",3156276568,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Mendez, Bryce H.

A Predictive Decision-Support Framework Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Mitigate Supply Chain Risks and Optimize On-Time Delivery of Gas Turbine Jet Engines,"This praxis explores the critical challenge of achieving on-time delivery (OTD) for precision components in gas turbine jet engines, which is essential for fulfilling Department of Defense contracts. The focus is on a prominent aerospace engine manufacturer recognized for its advanced technologies and significant market presence in both commercial and defense sectors. In 2023, the company generated approximately $26 billion in revenue, reflecting double-digit growth driven by strong demand across its portfolio.&#xa0; The manufacturer contends with substantial supply chain disruptions, including labor shortages, geopolitical tensions, and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. To address these challenges, a predictive decision-support tool utilizing machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting was developed. This tool integrates critical data on supplier performance and part complexity, enhancing the ability to forecast potential delays and allocate resources effectively. The predictive model supports proactive supply chain risk management, thereby optimizing OTD performance. The findings reveal that supplier ratings and part complexity significantly influence OTD, underscoring the practical value of predictive analytics in complex manufacturing settings. This decision-support framework not only improves supply chain resilience but also offers a scalable solution that can be adapted to other precision manufacturing industries dependent on timely deliveries.",3143053524,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Peeples, Thomas L., Jr.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2025," Machine learning , Supply Chain Management , Supply chain resilience , Supply chain risk management , OTD performance , On-time delivery", 9798346812104,,, English, English,,,,2025,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2025,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/predictive-decision-support-framework-using/docview/3143053524/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Predictive+Decision-Support+Framework+Using+Machine+Learning+Algorithms+to+Mitigate+Supply+Chain+Risks+and+Optimize+On-Time+Delivery+of+Gas+Turbine+Jet+Engines&amp;issn=&amp;date=2025-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Peeples%2C+Thomas+L.%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=9798346812104&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,praxis explores critical challenge achieving delivery otd precision component gas turbine jet engine essential fulfilling contract focus prominent aerospace engine manufacturer recognized advanced technology significant market presence commercial sector company generated approximately billion revenue reflecting growth driven strong demand across manufacturer contends substantial supply chain disruption including labor shortage geopolitical tension impact pandemic address challenge predictive tool utilizing machine learning algorithm random forest gradient boosting developed tool integrates critical supplier performance part complexity enhancing ability forecast potential delay allocate resource effectively predictive model support proactive supply chain risk management thereby optimizing otd performance finding reveal supplier rating part complexity significantly influence otd underscoring practical value predictive analytics complex manufacturing setting framework improves supply chain resilience also offer scalable solution adapted precision manufacturing industry dependent timely delivery,"['praxis', 'explores', 'critical', 'challenge', 'achieving', 'delivery', 'otd', 'precision', 'components', 'gas', 'turbine', 'jet', 'engines', 'essential', 'fulfilling', 'contracts', 'focus', 'prominent', 'aerospace', 'engine', 'manufacturer', 'recognized', 'advanced', 'technologies', 'significant', 'market', 'presence', 'commercial', 'sectors', 'company', 'generated', 'approximately', 'billion', 'revenue', 'reflecting', 'growth', 'driven', 'strong', 'demand', 'across', 'manufacturer', 'contends', 'substantial', 'supply', 'chain', 'disruptions', 'including', 'labor', 'shortages', 'geopolitical', 'tensions', 'impacts', 'pandemic', 'address', 'challenges', 'predictive', 'tool', 'utilizing', 'machine', 'learning', 'algorithms', 'random', 'forest', 'gradient', 'boosting', 'developed', 'tool', 'integrates', 'critical', 'data', 'supplier', 'performance', 'part', 'complexity', 'enhancing', 'ability', 'forecast', 'potential', 'delays', 'allocate', 'resources', 'effectively', 'predictive', 'model', 'supports', 'proactive', 'supply', 'chain', 'risk', 'management', 'thereby', 'optimizing', 'otd', 'performance', 'findings', 'reveal', 'supplier', 'ratings', 'part', 'complexity', 'significantly', 'influence', 'otd', 'underscoring', 'practical', 'value', 'predictive', 'analytics', 'complex', 'manufacturing', 'settings', 'framework', 'improves', 'supply', 'chain', 'resilience', 'also', 'offers', 'scalable', 'solution', 'adapted', 'precision', 'manufacturing', 'industries', 'dependent', 'timely', 'deliveries']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
Analyzing Factors That Contribute to Cost Overruns on Department of Defense (DoD) Contractor Programs,"The Department of Defense (DoD) is the key to the United States’ National Security. The organizational body is responsible for being a safeguard for U.S. citizens and an integral alliance to our allies. However, the DoD has been plagued by costly overruns on defense programs that are funded to provide armaments that allow our military the ability to respond to and protect against national and international threats. These costly overruns have plagued the Department of Defense (DoD), as early as 1977 with high occurrences of cost overruns on more than 500 major defense programs resulting in tens of billions of dollars spent over the past 25 years on weapons systems that were over budget, delivered late, or canceled (Smith, 2022). The overruns limit future research and development, impede the country’s defense capabilities, and disrupts the financial balance that affects taxpayers, healthcare, education, and transportation. This study examines DoD contract cost overruns by identifying and analyzing significant contributing factors and applying machine learning models to determine the likelihood of these overruns. The dataset for this research incorporated 524 records (262 overruns and 262 non- overruns) of various DoD contracts into four different supervised machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, gradient boosting, support vector machines, and random forest. The results outline which machine learning algorithm performed best using the induced dependent (overrun) and independent (factors) variables.",3142156496,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Funches Allen, Dawn",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2025," Classification , Cost overruns , Defense acquisition , Department of Defense , Diagnostic analytics , Machine learning", 9798346806165,,, English, English,,,,2025,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2025,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/analyzing-factors-that-contribute-cost-overruns/docview/3142156496/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Analyzing+Factors+That+Contribute+to+Cost+Overruns+on+Department+of+Defense+%28DoD%29+Contractor+Programs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2025-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Funches+Allen%2C+Dawn&amp;isbn=9798346806165&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,key united state national security organizational body responsible safeguard citizen integral alliance ally however plagued costly overrun program funded provide armament allow ability respond protect national international threat costly overrun plagued early high occurrence cost overrun major program resulting ten billion dollar spent past year weapon system budget delivered late canceled smith overrun limit future development impede country capability disrupts financial balance affect taxpayer healthcare education transportation examines contract cost overrun identifying analyzing significant contributing factor applying machine learning model determine likelihood overrun dataset incorporated record overrun overrun various contract four different supervised machine learning algorithm logistic regression gradient boosting support vector machine random forest result outline machine learning algorithm performed best using induced dependent overrun independent factor variable,"['key', 'united', 'states', 'national', 'security', 'organizational', 'body', 'responsible', 'safeguard', 'citizens', 'integral', 'alliance', 'allies', 'however', 'plagued', 'costly', 'overruns', 'programs', 'funded', 'provide', 'armaments', 'allow', 'ability', 'respond', 'protect', 'national', 'international', 'threats', 'costly', 'overruns', 'plagued', 'early', 'high', 'occurrences', 'cost', 'overruns', 'major', 'programs', 'resulting', 'tens', 'billions', 'dollars', 'spent', 'past', 'years', 'weapons', 'systems', 'budget', 'delivered', 'late', 'canceled', 'smith', 'overruns', 'limit', 'future', 'development', 'impede', 'country', 'capabilities', 'disrupts', 'financial', 'balance', 'affects', 'taxpayers', 'healthcare', 'education', 'transportation', 'examines', 'contract', 'cost', 'overruns', 'identifying', 'analyzing', 'significant', 'contributing', 'factors', 'applying', 'machine', 'learning', 'models', 'determine', 'likelihood', 'overruns', 'dataset', 'incorporated', 'records', 'overruns', 'overruns', 'various', 'contracts', 'four', 'different', 'supervised', 'machine', 'learning', 'algorithms', 'logistic', 'regression', 'gradient', 'boosting', 'support', 'vector', 'machines', 'random', 'forest', 'results', 'outline', 'machine', 'learning', 'algorithm', 'performed', 'best', 'using', 'induced', 'dependent', 'overrun', 'independent', 'factors', 'variables']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Continuous Learning
Imaging anatomy study related to unilateral biportal endoscopic lumbar spine surgery,"Purpose To provide lumbar spine anatomical parameters relevant to the UBE technique and explore their intraoperative application. Methods CT imaging data processed by Mimics for parametric measurements, including laminar abduction angle (LAA), laminar slope angle (LSA), minimum laminar height (MLH), distance between the inferior margin of the lamina and attachment of the ligamentum flavum onto the cephalad lamina (DLL), distance between the initial point and the middle of the articular process (DIA), and distance from the inferior margin of the lamina to the inferior border of the vertebral body (DLV), and were manually measured. Results LAA and DIA gradually increase from L1 to L5. At L1, the DIA is approximately the length of 2 drill bits with a diameter of 3&#xa0;mm (male: 7.77 ± 1.39&#xa0;mm, female: 7.22 ± 1.09&#xa0;mm), while at L5, it can reach the length of 4–5 drill bits (male: 14.96 ± 2.24&#xa0;mm, female: 13.67 ± 2.33&#xa0;mm). MLH, DLL, and DLV reach their maximum values at the L3 and decrease toward the cranial and caudal ends. The DLL is smallest at L5 (male: 9.58 ± 1.90&#xa0;mm, female: 9.38 ± 2.14&#xa0;mm), equivalent to the length of 3 drill bits, while the DLL at L3 is the length of 4–5 drill bits (male: 14.17 ± 2.13&#xa0;mm, female: 14.01 ± 2.07&#xa0;mm).

Qué hace falta para ganar tu primer rol como CIO,"“Hoy en día, es absolutamente necesario que los líderes tecnológicos comprendan lo que significan para la empresa la tecnología digital, la inteligencia artificial y los datos, además de tener un sólido conocimiento básico de la propia empresa y de todas las palancas que influyen en las ganancias y pérdidas”, afirma Brown, vicepresidenta sénior y directora de Información Digital del Boston Medical Center. Dada la importancia de la tecnología para la empresa y el ritmo acelerado de la transformación digital, no es de extrañar que los objetivos de los máximos responsables de TI sigan moviéndose. Vikram Nafde, vicepresidente ejecutivo y CIO de Webster Bank, afirma que tener una mentalidad centrada en el cliente ayuda a impulsar una sólida orientación estratégica empresarial. Nafde puso esto en práctica muy pronto, cuando se incorporó a Webster Bank en un momento en que la empresa se embarcaba en una fusión a partes iguales con otro banco. Contar con la atención y el apoyo de los altos directivos, incluido su antiguo mentor CIO, fue la otra pieza fundamental. “La gente no puede ayudarte a crecer y desarrollarte si no sabe hacia dónde te diriges”, afirma. Para llenar este vacío, CXO Connect, una organización comprometida con la formación y el entrenamiento de altos ejecutivos de TI, ha lanzado un Programa de Certificación Global CIO de 16 módulos diseñado para preparar a los ejecutivos para el liderazgo tecnológico de próxima generación en menos de un año. Frente al énfasis en la tecnología, los participantes aprenden a vender ideas a la junta directiva, desarrollar estrategias, perfeccionar modelos operativos, cultivar relaciones fructíferas, gestionar y retener el talento y profundizar en los aspectos financieros. “Enseñamos a los participantes a escuchar y a crear presencia para que, cuando hablen en una sala, la gente escuche y confíe en lo que se dice”. Grant Hodge, responsable de TI de Viridor, pasó por el Programa de Certificación Global CIO de CXO Connect para cubrir lagunas en su perfil de desarrollo cuando empezó a ascender en el escalafón de TI

"Signal Processing for Large Arrays : Convolutional Beamspace, Hybrid Analog and Digital Processing, and Distributed Algorithms","The estimation of the directions of arrival (DOAs) of incoming waves for a passive antenna array has long been an important topic in array signal processing. Meanwhile, the estimation of the MIMO channel between a transmit antenna array and a receive antenna array is a key problem in wireless communications. In many recent works on these array processing tasks, people consider millimeter waves (mmWaves) due to their potential to offer more bandwidth than the already highly occupied lower-frequency bands. However, new challenges like strong path loss at the high frequencies of mmWaves arise. To compensate for the path loss, large arrays, or massive MIMO, are used to get large beamforming gain. It is practical due to the small sizes of mmWave antennas. When large arrays are used, it is important to develop efficient estimation algorithms with low computational and hardware complexity. The main contribution of this thesis is to propose low-complexity DOA and channel estimation methods that are especially effective for large arrays. To achieve low complexity, three main aspects are explored: beamspace methods, hybrid analog and digital processing, and distributed algorithms. First, a new beamspace method, convolutional beamspace (CBS), is proposed for DOA estimation based on passive arrays. In CBS, the array output is spatially filtered, followed by uniform decimation (downsampling) to achieve dimensionality reduction. No DOA ambiguity occurs since the filter output is represented only by the passband sources. CBS enjoys the advantages of classical beamspace such as lower computational complexity, increased parallelism of subband processing, and improved resolution threshold for DOA estimation. Moreover, unlike classical beamspace methods, it allows root-MUSIC and ESPRIT to be performed directly for uniform linear arrays without additional preparation since the Vandermonde structure is preserved under the CBS transformation. The method produces more accurate DOA estimates than classical beamspace, and for correlated sources, better estimates than element-space. The idea of hybrid analog and digital processing is then incorporated into CBS, leading to hybrid CBS for DOA estimation. In hybrid processing, an analog combiner is used to reduce the number of radio frequency (RF) chains and thus hardware complexity. Also for lowering hardware cost, the analog combiner is designed as a phase shifter network with unit-modulus entries. It is shown that any general (arbitrary coefficient) CBS filter can be implemented despite the unit-modulus constraints. Moreover, a new scheme of CBS is proposed based on nonuniform decimation and difference coarray method. This allows us to identify more sources than RF chains. The retained samples correspond to the sensor locations of a virtual sparse array, dilated by an integer factor, which results in larger coarray aperture and thus better estimation performance. Besides, with the use of random or deterministic filter delays that vary with snapshots, a new method is proposed to decorrelate sources for the coarray method to work. Next, a 2-dimensional (2-D) hybrid CBS method is developed for mmWave MIMO channel estimation. Since mmWave channel estimation problems can be formulated as 2-D direction-of-departure (DOD) and DOA estimation, benefits of CBS such as low complexity are applicable here. The receiver operation is again filtering followed by decimation. A key novelty is the use of a proper counterpart of CBS at the transmitter—expansion (upsampling) followed by filtering—to reduce RF chains. The expansion and decimation can be either uniform or nonuniform. The nonuniform scheme is used with 2-D coarray method and requires fewer RF chains to achieve the same estimation performance as the uniform scheme. A method based on the introduction of filter delays is also proposed to decorrelate path gains, which is crucial to the success of coarray methods. It is shown that given fixed pilot overhead, 2-D hybrid CBS can yield more accurate channel estimates than previous methods. Finally, distributed (decentralized) algorithms for array signal processing are studied. With the potential of reducing computation and communication complexity, distributed estimation of covariance, and distributed principal component analysis have been introduced and studied in the signal processing community in recent years. Applications in array processing have been also indicated in some detail. In this thesis, distributed algorithms are further developed for several well-known methods for DOA estimation and beamforming. New distributed algorithms are proposed for DOA estimation methods like root-MUSIC, total least squares ESPRIT, and FOCUSS. Other contributions include distributed design of the Capon beamformer from data, distributed implementation of the spatial smoothing method for coherent sources, and distributed realization of CBS. The proposed algorithms are fully distributed since average consensus (AC) is used to avoid the need for a fusion center. The algorithms are based on a finite-time version of AC which converges to the exact solution in a finite number of iterations. This enables the proposed distributed algorithms to achieve the same performance as the centralized counterparts, as demonstrated by simulations.",3110417896,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Chen,

Dynamic Instability Investigation of the Automotive Driveshaft’s Forced Torsional Vibration Using the Asymptotic Method,"Featured Application The first-order asymptotic method (FOAM) is used to analyze the dynamic instability in the area of principal parametric resonance (APPR) for the automotive driveshaft’s (AD) forced torsional vibration (ADFTV). Abstract This paper aims to investigate using FOAM to analyze the dynamic instability in the APPR for ADFTV based on a dynamic model (DMADFTV). The DMADFTV considers the following aspects: AD kinematic nonuniformity (ADKN), AD geometric nonuniformity (ADGN) of inertial characteristics for the spinning movements (ICSM) of the AD elements (ADE), and the excitations induced by the gearbox–internal combustion engine modulations. The DMADFTV is considered the already-designed dynamic model developed by the first author of the ADFTV in a previous publication. This DMADFTV was used to compute the stationary frontiers of instability and the nonstationary spectral velocity amplitude (NSVA) versus nonstationary spectral amplitude (NSA) in the configuration space in transition through APPR, using the FOAM. The use of FOAM is much more versatile, from the analytical point of view, than the method of multiple scales and allows the computation of the NSA and the NSVA in the APPR. In contrast, these computations cannot be performed using the harmonic balance method. MATLAB Software R 2017 was developed based on DMADFTV and used the FOAM to compute the stationary frontiers of instability and the NSVA versus the NSA in transition through APPR for the ADFTV. The numerical results were compared with the experimental and numerical data published in the literature, finding agreements. The computation of the NSVA versus NSA in the configuration space using FOAM represents a method of detection of the chaotic manifestation of ADFTV.",3103860677,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Bugaru, Mihai;Vasile, Ovidiu",,," © 2024 by the authors.

Project Engineers on the Frontline: The Impact of Work-Related Stressors and Turnover Intentions: A Correlational Study,"Work-related stress and its impact on employee turnover intentions represent a significant concern for organizations, particularly in demanding fields like engineering. This quantitative correlational study investigated the relationship between work-related stressors and turnover intentions among project engineers employed by private U.S. engineering firms serving public and private sector clients, including the Department of Defense (DoD). The study's purpose was to examine whether job stress predicts contemplation about resigning from current employment among engineers in these high-pressure roles. The conceptual framework integrated Mobley's turnover process model, the job demands-resources model, Maslach's burnout inventory, and the conservation of resources theory. A survey was administered to a sample of 81 project engineers, with 69 providing complete responses for analysis. The survey utilized validated scales to measure work-related stressors and turnover intentions. Data were processed and analyzed using IBM SPSS v29. Results revealed a strong positive correlation (r = .662, p &lt; .001) between work stress scores and turnover intention scores, supporting the theoretical models. Regression analysis confirmed that work-related stress significantly predicted 43.8% of the variance in turnover intentions (F(1, 68) = 53.029, p &lt; .001). The findings validated the hypotheses, demonstrating a significant relationship between work stressors and increased propensity for resignation contemplation among project engineers. The study's implications highlight the need for organizations to develop interventions mitigating excessive job demands, providing adequate resources, fostering supportive leadership, and promoting coping strategies to reduce harmful work stress and curb voluntary turnover among valuable engineering talent. Recommendations include job redesign, leadership development, fostering a supportive climate, providing coping resources, and a multifaceted approach to mitigate work-related stress and turnover.",3101099933,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Turner, Shane P.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2024," Burnout , Engineers , Job demands , Retention , Stress , Turnover", 9798384064862,,, English, English,,,,2024,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2024,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/project-engineers-on-frontline-impact-work/docview/3101099933/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Project+Engineers+on+the+Frontline%3A+The+Impact+of+Work-Related+Stressors+and+Turnover+Intentions%3A+A+Correlational+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2024-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Turner%2C+Shane+P.&amp;isbn=9798384064862&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,stress impact employee turnover intention represent significant concern organization particularly demanding field like engineering quantitative correlational investigated relationship stressor turnover intention among project engineer employed private engineering firm serving public private sector client including purpose examine whether job stress predicts contemplation resigning current employment among engineer role conceptual framework integrated mobley turnover process model job model maslach burnout inventory conservation resource theory survey administered sample project engineer providing complete response survey utilized validated scale measure stressor turnover intention processed analyzed using ibm spss result revealed strong positive correlation work stress score turnover intention score supporting theoretical model regression confirmed stress significantly predicted variance turnover intention finding validated hypothesis demonstrating significant relationship work stressor increased propensity resignation contemplation among project engineer implication highlight need organization develop intervention mitigating excessive job demand providing adequate resource fostering supportive leadership promoting coping strategy reduce harmful work stress curb voluntary turnover among valuable engineering talent recommendation include job redesign leadership development fostering supportive climate providing coping resource multifaceted mitigate stress turnover,"['stress', 'impact', 'employee', 'turnover', 'intentions', 'represent', 'significant', 'concern', 'organizations', 'particularly', 'demanding', 'fields', 'like', 'engineering', 'quantitative', 'correlational', 'investigated', 'relationship', 'stressors', 'turnover', 'intentions', 'among', 'project', 'engineers', 'employed', 'private', 'engineering', 'firms', 'serving', 'public', 'private', 'sector', 'clients', 'including', 'purpose', 'examine', 'whether', 'job', 'stress', 'predicts', 'contemplation', 'resigning', 'current', 'employment', 'among', 'engineers', 'roles', 'conceptual', 'framework', 'integrated', 'mobley', 'turnover', 'process', 'model', 'job', 'model', 'maslach', 'burnout', 'inventory', 'conservation', 'resources', 'theory', 'survey', 'administered', 'sample', 'project', 'engineers', 'providing', 'complete', 'responses', 'survey', 'utilized', 'validated', 'scales', 'measure', 'stressors', 'turnover', 'intentions', 'data', 'processed', 'analyzed', 'using', 'ibm', 'spss', 'results', 'revealed', 'strong', 'positive', 'correlation', 'work', 'stress', 'scores', 'turnover', 'intention', 'scores', 'supporting', 'theoretical', 'models', 'regression', 'confirmed', 'stress', 'significantly', 'predicted', 'variance', 'turnover', 'intentions', 'findings', 'validated', 'hypotheses', 'demonstrating', 'significant', 'relationship', 'work', 'stressors', 'increased', 'propensity', 'resignation', 'contemplation', 'among', 'project', 'engineers', 'implications', 'highlight', 'need', 'organizations', 'develop', 'interventions', 'mitigating', 'excessive', 'job', 'demands', 'providing', 'adequate', 'resources', 'fostering', 'supportive', 'leadership', 'promoting', 'coping', 'strategies', 'reduce', 'harmful', 'work', 'stress', 'curb', 'voluntary', 'turnover', 'among', 'valuable', 'engineering', 'talent', 'recommendations', 'include', 'job', 'redesign', 'leadership', 'development', 'fostering', 'supportive', 'climate', 'providing', 'coping', 'resources', 'multifaceted', 'mitigate', 'stress', 'turnover']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
The Ontology of Nurse Wellbeing Within United States Air Force Primary Care Medical Homes,"Knowing the experiences or processes of nurse wellbeing within primary care medical homes (PCMHs) is necessary to move the fields of nursing and wellbeing forward. Using reflexive interpretive description methodology, this study’s purpose was to answer the question: “What is the ontology of nurse wellbeing within U.S. Air Force PCMHs?” Additional aims sought to: •	explore how or what (a) healthcare delivery system, (b) practice (work) environment, and (c) individual RN factors influence an RN’s perceived ability to experience wellbeing; and •	explore how the PCMH nurse defines nurse wellbeing, and how this compares to contemporary wellbeing models. Conceptual Basis: There exists a nursing microsystem within NASEM’s (2019) Systems Model of Clinician Burnout and Professional Well-Being that illustrates a feedback loop system. Using a Donabedian framework of structure-process-outcome, the proposed model contained 1) the three levels of healthcare delivery in the context of a PCMH as structure, 2) work-system factors represented by the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI) as process, and 3) professional wellbeing represented by WellBQ as outcome. Methods: Data collection was from participant interviews ( n =20) and a focus group ( n =4) concentrated at three Western U.S. Air Force Military Treatment Facilities. For thematic variation, participants ( n =9) with similar roles and workplaces were sought outside this area. Data analysis was guided by reflexive thematic analysis and ATLAS.ti 24 in which the patterns of meaning and development of themes were explored across three PCMH nurse roles: team RN, nurse manager, and nurse practitioner. Findings: There was a professional nurse identity mismatch, especially for active-duty (AD) nurses, as nurses did not view their roles as a nursing one. Working in a military environment can serve as a unifying measure, but it also causes division among nursing staff. Nurses voiced a desire to be heardas demonstrated by leaders’ (in)action. The work demands and status as a civilian or AD affect engagement at home and work. Nurses desire mentorship and face conflict with career stagnation for civilian nurses and forced leadership positions for AD.

Optimizing Moon Energy Storage for Resilience: A 20-Year Life Cycle Approach,"This thesis addresses a critical challenge in optimizing the size and operation of an energy storage unit for lunar microgrids. A lunar base requires a dependable electrical power system but cost-effectiveness and long-term reliability hinges on minimizing overall system complexity. This study focuses on battery technology and presents an algorithm to identify the smallest possible battery that can meet the energy needs of the microgrid for the intended duration of the battery’s life and, simultaneously, determines the battery’s ideal operating conditions. The proposed algorithm analyzes the complex relationship between lunar solar illumination patterns, the microgrid's power consumption profiles, and the battery's degradation affected by the depth of discharge (DOD) and maximum state of charge (SOC) of the battery over time. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis investigates the effects of the initial battery charge and the size of the photovoltaic (PV) system on overall performance. This study proposes an optimized battery solution for a 20-year design life by aiming to maximize solar energy capture while minimizing battery stress. In the end, these findings contribute significantly to the development of self-sufficient lunar bases by enabling the selection of the most efficient and reliable battery for their microgrids.",3086642477,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Lau, Sally Si Min",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2024," Energy storage , Genetic algorithm , Lithium-ion battery , Lunar microgrids , Optimization algorithms , Space microgrids", 9798383580080,,, English, English,,,,2024,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2024,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/optimizing-moon-energy-storage-resilience-20-year/docview/3086642477/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Optimizing+Moon+Energy+Storage+for+Resilience%3A+A+20-Year+Life+Cycle+Approach&amp;issn=&amp;date=2024-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lau%2C+Sally+Si+Min&amp;isbn=9798383580080&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,address critical challenge optimizing size operation energy storage unit lunar microgrids lunar base requires dependable electrical power system reliability hinge minimizing overall system complexity focus battery technology present algorithm identify smallest possible battery meet energy need microgrid intended duration battery life simultaneously determines battery ideal operating condition proposed algorithm analyzes complex relationship lunar solar illumination pattern microgrid power consumption profile battery degradation affected depth discharge maximum state charge soc battery time additionally sensitivity investigates effect initial battery charge size photovoltaic system overall performance proposes optimized battery solution design life aiming maximize solar energy capture minimizing battery stress end finding contribute significantly development lunar base enabling selection efficient reliable battery microgrids,"['thesis', 'addresses', 'critical', 'challenge', 'optimizing', 'size', 'operation', 'energy', 'storage', 'unit', 'lunar', 'microgrids', 'lunar', 'base', 'requires', 'dependable', 'electrical', 'power', 'system', 'reliability', 'hinges', 'minimizing', 'overall', 'system', 'complexity', 'focuses', 'battery', 'technology', 'presents', 'algorithm', 'identify', 'smallest', 'possible', 'battery', 'meet', 'energy', 'needs', 'microgrid', 'intended', 'duration', 'battery', 'life', 'simultaneously', 'determines', 'battery', 'ideal', 'operating', 'conditions', 'proposed', 'algorithm', 'analyzes', 'complex', 'relationship', 'lunar', 'solar', 'illumination', 'patterns', 'microgrid', 'power', 'consumption', 'profiles', 'battery', 'degradation', 'affected', 'depth', 'discharge', 'maximum', 'state', 'charge', 'soc', 'battery', 'time', 'additionally', 'sensitivity', 'investigates', 'effects', 'initial', 'battery', 'charge', 'size', 'photovoltaic', 'system', 'overall', 'performance', 'proposes', 'optimized', 'battery', 'solution', 'design', 'life', 'aiming', 'maximize', 'solar', 'energy', 'capture', 'minimizing', 'battery', 'stress', 'end', 'findings', 'contribute', 'significantly', 'development', 'lunar', 'bases', 'enabling', 'selection', 'efficient', 'reliable', 'battery', 'microgrids']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
<strong>Skills of an Effective United States Air Force Program Manager:</strong> A Qualitative Descriptive Study of the Skills Required for United States Air Force Program Managers,"The United States Air Force (USAF) purchases billions in arms, equipment, and services to support the Department of Defense and its mission to defend the public from all enemies, foreign and domestic. Program Managers (PM) are the leaders appointed to develop, deliver, and sustain a solution for the capability gaps identified by operational leaders. PMs oversee programs of all sizes across many domains. A substantial proportion of programs fail to meet the triple constraint of cost, schedule, and performance. It is in the interest of the public who funds these purchases to identify the skills that can help PMs deliver programs within the triple constraint. PMs require skills to lead an effective program. The researcher used Katz's (1955) framework to identify the technical, human, and conceptual skills PMs need. The researcher interviewed nine retired United States Air Force acquisition members and identified seventeen PM skills required to deliver programs within the triple constraint alongside other observations about the acquisition field. The seventeen skills include (1) General Military Knowledge, (2) Programmatic Knowledge, (3) Functional Knowledge, (4) Program-specific Knowledge, (5) Technological Proficiency, (6) Leadership, (7) Mentorship, (8) Communication, (9) Relationship Management, (10) Emotional Intelligence, (11) Political Skills, (12) Stakeholder Management, (13) Requirement Management, (14) Problem-solving, (15) Critical Thinking, (16) Outlook, and (17) Continuity.&#xa0; PMs can use the seventeen skills from this study as possible competencies to identify where they excel and need improvement and create a plan of action to improve performance at their current job and prepare for the next. Career managers can use the skill set as criteria to consider in selecting, developing, and retaining PMs to meet today's and tomorrow's needs. Additionally, the USAF should incorporate the seventeen skills into professional development,&#xa0;education, and training. The study further serves as a template for future studies and meritocratic initiatives within the defense acquisition workforce.&#xa0;",2933806305,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Rowlands, Shane C.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2024," Program Managers , Defense acquisitions , Operational leaders , United States Air Force , Skills management", 9798381749052,,, English, English,,,,2024,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2024,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/strong-skills-effective-united-states-air-force/docview/2933806305/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Skills+of+an+Effective+United+States+Air+Force+Program+Manager%3A+A+Qualitative+Descriptive+Study+of+the+Skills+Required+for+United+States+Air+Force+Program+Managers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2024-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rowlands%2C+Shane+C.&amp;isbn=9798381749052&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,united state air force usaf purchase billion arm equipment service support mission defend public enemy foreign domestic program manager leader appointed develop deliver sustain solution capability gap identified operational leader pm oversee program size across many domain substantial proportion program fail meet triple constraint cost schedule performance interest public fund purchase identify skill help pm deliver program within triple constraint pm require skill lead effective program researcher used katz framework identify technical human conceptual skill pm need researcher interviewed nine retired united state air force acquisition member identified seventeen skill required deliver program within triple constraint alongside observation acquisition field seventeen skill include general knowledge programmatic knowledge functional knowledge knowledge technological proficiency leadership mentorship communication relationship management emotional intelligence political skill stakeholder management requirement management critical thinking outlook pm use seventeen skill possible competency identify excel need improvement create plan action improve performance current job prepare next career manager use skill set criterion consider selecting developing retaining pm meet today tomorrow need additionally usaf incorporate seventeen skill professional development education training serf template future study meritocratic initiative within acquisition,"['united', 'states', 'air', 'force', 'usaf', 'purchases', 'billions', 'arms', 'equipment', 'services', 'support', 'mission', 'defend', 'public', 'enemies', 'foreign', 'domestic', 'program', 'managers', 'leaders', 'appointed', 'develop', 'deliver', 'sustain', 'solution', 'capability', 'gaps', 'identified', 'operational', 'leaders', 'pms', 'oversee', 'programs', 'sizes', 'across', 'many', 'domains', 'substantial', 'proportion', 'programs', 'fail', 'meet', 'triple', 'constraint', 'cost', 'schedule', 'performance', 'interest', 'public', 'funds', 'purchases', 'identify', 'skills', 'help', 'pms', 'deliver', 'programs', 'within', 'triple', 'constraint', 'pms', 'require', 'skills', 'lead', 'effective', 'program', 'researcher', 'used', 'katz', 'framework', 'identify', 'technical', 'human', 'conceptual', 'skills', 'pms', 'need', 'researcher', 'interviewed', 'nine', 'retired', 'united', 'states', 'air', 'force', 'acquisition', 'members', 'identified', 'seventeen', 'skills', 'required', 'deliver', 'programs', 'within', 'triple', 'constraint', 'alongside', 'observations', 'acquisition', 'field', 'seventeen', 'skills', 'include', 'general', 'knowledge', 'programmatic', 'knowledge', 'functional', 'knowledge', 'knowledge', 'technological', 'proficiency', 'leadership', 'mentorship', 'communication', 'relationship', 'management', 'emotional', 'intelligence', 'political', 'skills', 'stakeholder', 'management', 'requirement', 'management', 'critical', 'thinking', 'outlook', 'pms', 'use', 'seventeen', 'skills', 'possible', 'competencies', 'identify', 'excel', 'need', 'improvement', 'create', 'plan', 'action', 'improve', 'performance', 'current', 'job', 'prepare', 'next', 'career', 'managers', 'use', 'skill', 'set', 'criteria', 'consider', 'selecting', 'developing', 'retaining', 'pms', 'meet', 'today', 'tomorrow', 'needs', 'additionally', 'usaf', 'incorporate', 'seventeen', 'skills', 'professional', 'development', 'education', 'training', 'serves', 'template', 'future', 'studies', 'meritocratic', 'initiatives', 'within', 'acquisition']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Continuous Learning
Leadership Development Strategies for Sustaining Organization Performance Through the Upper Echelon Theory,"Organizational leaders within the Department of the Army in the Military District of Washington frequently experience turnover that necessitates a new leader's transition into a position. These new leaders sometimes experience challenges in successfully transitioning into the organization to maintain the continuity of operations. Grounded in the upper echelon theory, the purpose of this qualitative pragmatic inquiry was to explore strategies senior leaders use to transition new subordinate leaders into their organization successfully. The participants included eight military and civilian leaders with more than eight years of knowledge and experience in employing effective strategies for developing midlevel managers. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and information in the public domain. Through thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (a) being knowledgeable of the organization during change, (b) employing effective communication skills, (c) being a flexible and adaptive leader, (d) employing measures of performance, and (e) formal and informal leader development. A key recommendation is for senior leaders to assess the performance of midlevel managers experiencing challenges with leading to identify areas needing tailored development. The implications for positive social change have the potential to enhance the organization's internal culture and extend a positive influence on the broader society.",2928501574,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"McCants, Marjorie H.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2024," Leader behavior , Leader continuity , Leader development , Leader sustainability , Leader transition , Mid-level manager", 9798381711547,,, English, English,,,,2024,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2024,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/leadership-development-strategies-sustaining/docview/2928501574/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Leadership+Development+Strategies+for+Sustaining+Organization+Performance+Through+the+Upper+Echelon+Theory&amp;issn=&amp;date=2024-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McCants%2C+Marjorie+H.&amp;isbn=9798381711547&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,organizational leader within army district washington frequently experience turnover necessitates new leader transition position new leader sometimes experience challenge successfully transitioning organization maintain continuity operation grounded upper echelon theory purpose qualitative pragmatic inquiry explore strategy senior leader use transition new subordinate leader organization successfully participant included eight civilian leader eight year knowledge experience employing effective strategy developing midlevel manager collected using interview information public domain thematic five theme emerged knowledgeable organization change employing effective communication skill flexible adaptive leader employing measure performance formal informal leader development key recommendation senior leader assess performance midlevel manager experiencing challenge leading identify area needing tailored development implication positive social change potential enhance organization internal culture extend positive influence broader society,"['organizational', 'leaders', 'within', 'army', 'district', 'washington', 'frequently', 'experience', 'turnover', 'necessitates', 'new', 'leader', 'transition', 'position', 'new', 'leaders', 'sometimes', 'experience', 'challenges', 'successfully', 'transitioning', 'organization', 'maintain', 'continuity', 'operations', 'grounded', 'upper', 'echelon', 'theory', 'purpose', 'qualitative', 'pragmatic', 'inquiry', 'explore', 'strategies', 'senior', 'leaders', 'use', 'transition', 'new', 'subordinate', 'leaders', 'organization', 'successfully', 'participants', 'included', 'eight', 'civilian', 'leaders', 'eight', 'years', 'knowledge', 'experience', 'employing', 'effective', 'strategies', 'developing', 'midlevel', 'managers', 'data', 'collected', 'using', 'interviews', 'information', 'public', 'domain', 'thematic', 'five', 'themes', 'emerged', 'knowledgeable', 'organization', 'change', 'employing', 'effective', 'communication', 'skills', 'flexible', 'adaptive', 'leader', 'employing', 'measures', 'performance', 'formal', 'informal', 'leader', 'development', 'key', 'recommendation', 'senior', 'leaders', 'assess', 'performance', 'midlevel', 'managers', 'experiencing', 'challenges', 'leading', 'identify', 'areas', 'needing', 'tailored', 'development', 'implications', 'positive', 'social', 'change', 'potential', 'enhance', 'organization', 'internal', 'culture', 'extend', 'positive', 'influence', 'broader', 'society']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership

Performance Indicators for Collaborative Business Ecosystems,"Today, in a rapidly changing world facing significant challenges, fostering collaboration to en-hance our resilience against disruptive factors, such as the recent pandemic, is crucial. In the business realm, sustainable collaboration is critical for companies when coping with a highly competitive and aggressive global market environment and becoming more resilient to attacks or disruptive events. Sustainable collaboration, is the ability to create a resilient and adaptable collaborative process capable of maintaining effectiveness and positive long-term outcomes. On the other hand, the continued growth of technology, globalisation and market com-petitiveness has highlighted the importance of collaboration for business success with a focus on business ecosystems. As a result, many approaches have emerged aimed at modelling and analysing them. A business ecosystem is a long-term strategic collaborative network of organ-isations that promotes common business processes, provides interoperable collaboration in-frastructures, and facilitates trust-building among its members. An essential aspect in this context is evaluating the collaboration performance among organisations in the ecosystem to identify potential earnings and promote the sustainability of the collaboration. However, despite the benefits of collaboration widely mentioned in the lit-erature, adequate performance indicators still lack to measure such benefits for business eco-systems. To this end, aiming to emphasise the importance of collaboration among organisa-tions, we adopted the term Collaborative Business Ecosystem (CBE) to represent a long-term strategic collaborative network that aims to help its members be prepared to engage in col-laborative business opportunities. It is expected that the measurement of collaboration in a CBE can influence the organisations' behaviour to evolve towards better performance, thus contributing to the sustainability of the CBE. To guide our work and address the abovementioned gap, we adopted the design science research (DSR) method, following the three DSR cycles and steps. Anchored in the state-of-art of the most related research areas, we proposed a novel design artefact in the form of a sim-ulation model, the Performance Assessment and Adjustment Model (PAAM), composed of a set of Performance Indicators adequate to assess collaboration in a CBE, and an Influence Mechanism to induce an influencing factor on the organisations to improve their behaviour, thus contributing to the ecosystem performance and collaboration sustainability. For evaluat-ing PAAM, several simulation scenarios were established, representing a CBE shaped with ac-tual data from three IT organisations operating in the same business ecosystem. The final val-idation involved a focus group of managers from the organisations who provided the data by participating in workshops and filling in a questionnaire on their ""usefulness, ease of use and intention to use"" PAAM. The validation showed that PAAM could reflect real-life collaboration situations when fuelled by actual data from the IT industry or other industry sectors. Finally, the results were disseminated in peer-reviewed international conference pro-ceedings and journals. This work contributes to scientific knowledge with a performance as-sessment framework comprising a set of performance indicators adequate to evaluate the col-laboration in a CBE and an influence mechanism to study how these indicators can influence the organisations' behaviour to improve the CBE performance and collaboration sustainability.",3098798256,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"de Brito

Lean Six Sigma Application in the Healthcare Sector a Case Study in a Gynaecology Exam Room,"The healthcare sector plays an important role in the world economy and health institutions have a growing concern about the quality of their services. This means an effective and fast response to achieve a better service quality and a strong response to patient’s needs. This project urges as a need to enlarge the offer and the efficiency of the Cervix and Lower Genital Tract Unit of a Portuguese Hospital to improve the client satisfaction and increase the hospital service levels. Therefore, the Lean Six Sigma methodology was used recurring to the Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, Control (DMAIC) cycle in which many different quality tools and techniques were used. After careful observation of the unit, and data analysis, it was possible to identify some space for improvement. Although two different projects were initially identified, only one of them was implemented. The project implemented was related to the client experience with the exams performed in this department. The other project identified was related to the registering procedures used at the hospital but it was not possible to proceed with it due to lack of resources. After the full implementation, it was possible to eliminate 33% of the non-value added activities, reduce the waiting time by an average of 10 minutes by eliminating the subwaiting moment, reduce the total exam time by an average of 3 minutes, cutting 80 minutes per day in the Front-Office Customer Service Technicians Tasks and an overall restructure of Scheduling System.

The Influence of Attachment Styles and Mental Health Symptoms on Marital Satisfaction Among Deployed US Army Soldiers,"Since 2002, changes in the frequency, duration, and nature of military campaigns overseas have piqued efforts to understand the effects of deployment on the mental health of DoD service members, especially married Army soldiers. However, few studies have examined the impact of secure/insecure attachment styles on the emotional health of combat veterans and the reverberating, emotionally disruptive residuals of wartime impact they have had on their families, particularly on spouses. Thus, in the context of military deployments, this study examines how secure/insecure attachment styles, posttraumatic stress (PTS), and depressive symptoms significantly influence married soldiers and their perceptions of marital satisfaction. In addition, this study also examines pre-existent, internalized, and interpretative variables, suggesting how soldiers understand their spouses from either a positive or negative perspective. From a data set supplied by the Texas A&amp;M University-Central Texas (TAMUCT) Department of Counseling and Psychology, 1,347 married soldiers out of 4,089 participants from Ft. Riley, Kansas, responded to interviews and self-reporting surveys following a 12-month deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan from 2005 to 2006. Married soldiers who were legally separated from their spouses when deployed reported higher levels of posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms more frequently than their married counterparts, regardless of one’s insecure attachment style: Anxious (preoccupied), Avoidant (dismissive), or Disorganized (fearful-avoidant). These variables may prove statistically significant regarding how married and maritally estranged soldiers perceive marital satisfaction as impacted by secure/insecure attachment styles, PTS, and depressive symptoms.",2918108500,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Mora, Leo, Jr.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2023," Attachment style , Depression , Marital satisfaction , Married soldiers", 9798381431612,,, English, English,,,,2023,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2023,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/influence-attachment-styles-mental-health/docview/2918108500/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Influence+of+Attachment+Styles+and+Mental+Health+Symptoms+on+Marital+Satisfaction+Among+Deployed+US+Army+Soldiers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2023-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mora%2C+Leo%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=9798381431612&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Health Research Premium Collection, ProQuest One Academic",since change frequency duration nature campaign overseas piqued effort understand effect deployment mental health service member especially married army soldier however study examined impact attachment style emotional health combat veteran reverberating emotionally disruptive residual wartime impact family particularly spouse thus context deployment examines attachment style posttraumatic stress pt depressive symptom significantly influence married soldier perception marital satisfaction addition also examines internalized interpretative variable suggesting soldier understand spouse either positive negative perspective set supplied texas amp texas tamuct counseling psychology married soldier participant riley kansa responded interview survey following deployment iraq afghanistan married soldier legally separated spouse deployed reported higher level posttraumatic stress depressive symptom frequently married counterpart regardless one insecure attachment style anxious preoccupied avoidant dismissive disorganized variable may prove statistically significant regarding married maritally estranged soldier perceive marital satisfaction impacted attachment style pt depressive symptom,"['since', 'changes', 'frequency', 'duration', 'nature', 'campaigns', 'overseas', 'piqued', 'efforts', 'understand', 'effects', 'deployment', 'mental', 'health', 'service', 'members', 'especially', 'married', 'army', 'soldiers', 'however', 'studies', 'examined', 'impact', 'attachment', 'styles', 'emotional', 'health', 'combat', 'veterans', 'reverberating', 'emotionally', 'disruptive', 'residuals', 'wartime', 'impact', 'families', 'particularly', 'spouses', 'thus', 'context', 'deployments', 'examines', 'attachment', 'styles', 'posttraumatic', 'stress', 'pts', 'depressive', 'symptoms', 'significantly', 'influence', 'married', 'soldiers', 'perceptions', 'marital', 'satisfaction', 'addition', 'also', 'examines', 'internalized', 'interpretative', 'variables', 'suggesting', 'soldiers', 'understand', 'spouses', 'either', 'positive', 'negative', 'perspective', 'data', 'set', 'supplied', 'texas', 'amp', 'texas', 'tamuct', 'counseling', 'psychology', 'married', 'soldiers', 'participants', 'riley', 'kansas', 'responded', 'interviews', 'surveys', 'following', 'deployment', 'iraq', 'afghanistan', 'married', 'soldiers', 'legally', 'separated', 'spouses', 'deployed', 'reported', 'higher', 'levels', 'posttraumatic', 'stress', 'depressive', 'symptoms', 'frequently', 'married', 'counterparts', 'regardless', 'one', 'insecure', 'attachment', 'style', 'anxious', 'preoccupied', 'avoidant', 'dismissive', 'disorganized', 'variables', 'may', 'prove', 'statistically', 'significant', 'regarding', 'married', 'maritally', 'estranged', 'soldiers', 'perceive', 'marital', 'satisfaction', 'impacted', 'attachment', 'styles', 'pts', 'depressive', 'symptoms']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Transitioning From Military Life: Furthering Higher Education for the Air Force Enlisted Member,"The transition from the Air Force to civilian life can be a challenging process for enlisted members because of inconsistent and limited information provided by transition counselors at Air Force Base Airmen and Family Readiness Centers. The Department of Defense mandates the establishment of these centers down to the base level; however, counselors are restricted in the scope of topics they can address, potentially leaving gaps in the Transition Assistance Program (TAP). The purpose of this study was to determine necessary and effective transition education for enlisted Air Force members to help them access available resources and better prepare them for postmilitary life. Mismanaged transitions can lead to negative consequences for veterans and affect their benefits. For many transitioning members, the Post-9/11 GI Bill is a critical tool for pursuing education. This study explored the transitional needs of veterans to define what elements of TAP are missing for transitioning, Air Force-enlisted members to effectively be able to further their education using their allotted benefits.",2917103023,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Patrick, Savannah M.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2023," Transition Assistance Program , Transitional needs , Air Force , Transition counselors , Transition education", 9798381413755,,, English, English,,,,2023,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2023,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/transitioning-military-life-furthering-higher/docview/2917103023/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transitioning+From+Military+Life%3A+Furthering+Higher+Education+for+the+Air+Force+Enlisted+Member&amp;issn=&amp;date=2023-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Patrick%2C+Savannah+M.&amp;isbn=9798381413755&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,transition air force civilian life challenging process enlisted member inconsistent limited information provided transition counselor air force base airman family readiness center mandate establishment center base level however counselor restricted scope topic address potentially leaving gap transition assistance program tap purpose determine necessary effective transition education enlisted air force member help access available resource better prepare postmilitary life mismanaged transition lead negative consequence veteran affect benefit many transitioning member bill critical tool pursuing education explored transitional need veteran define element tap missing transitioning air member effectively able education using allotted benefit,"['transition', 'air', 'force', 'civilian', 'life', 'challenging', 'process', 'enlisted', 'members', 'inconsistent', 'limited', 'information', 'provided', 'transition', 'counselors', 'air', 'force', 'base', 'airmen', 'family', 'readiness', 'centers', 'mandates', 'establishment', 'centers', 'base', 'level', 'however', 'counselors', 'restricted', 'scope', 'topics', 'address', 'potentially', 'leaving', 'gaps', 'transition', 'assistance', 'program', 'tap', 'purpose', 'determine', 'necessary', 'effective', 'transition', 'education', 'enlisted', 'air', 'force', 'members', 'help', 'access', 'available', 'resources', 'better', 'prepare', 'postmilitary', 'life', 'mismanaged', 'transitions', 'lead', 'negative', 'consequences', 'veterans', 'affect', 'benefits', 'many', 'transitioning', 'members', 'bill', 'critical', 'tool', 'pursuing', 'education', 'explored', 'transitional', 'needs', 'veterans', 'define', 'elements', 'tap', 'missing', 'transitioning', 'air', 'members', 'effectively', 'able', 'education', 'using', 'allotted', 'benefits']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Process Improvement
Improving Defense Acquisition Process Timelines in a System Program Office,"Historically, even with decades of attempted reform efforts, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) has a record of difficulty fielding weapons on schedule (Hinton, 2000; Keating et al., 2018; Weisgerber, 2014). Moreover, multiple levels of Air Force leadership agreed that lengthy acquisitions were a problem that needed fixing (Air Force News Service, 2019; Pope, 2022). The review of relevant research in this study underscored the complexity of the defense acquisition system, outlined the long history of reform initiatives, and highlighted recommendations in the literature. This study addressed the problem of unnecessary delays in defense acquisition that impeded the delivery of needs or capabilities with resulting impacts on the mission. I used the performance improvement/Human Performance Technology (HPT) model as the roadmap and framed the analysis with the three performance levels (organization, process, performer) described by Rummler and Brache (Rummler &amp; Brache, 2012; Rummler-Brache Group, 2022; Van Tiem et al., 2012). The three performance levels directly aligned with the three improvement areas (system, process, workforce) discovered in the research (Hinton, 2000; Peters, 2014; Reeves, 2014; Rummler &amp; Brache, 2012; Rummler-Brache Group, 2022).&#xa0;",2900813052,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Armstrong, John Henry, Jr.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2023," Defense acquisition , Performance improvement , United States , Reform initiatives , Air Force", 9798381153019,,, English, English,,,,2023,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2023,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/improving-defense-acquisition-process-timelines/docview/2900813052/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Improving+Defense+Acquisition+Process+Timelines+in+a+System+Program+Office&amp;issn=&amp;date=2023-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Armstrong%2C+John+Henry%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=9798381153019&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",historically even decade attempted reform effort united state record difficulty fielding weapon schedule hinton keating weisgerber moreover multiple level air force leadership agreed lengthy acquisition problem needed fixing air force news service pope review relevant underscored complexity acquisition system outlined long history reform initiative highlighted recommendation literature addressed problem unnecessary delay acquisition impeded delivery need capability resulting impact mission used performance performance technology hpt model roadmap framed three performance level organization process performer described rummler brache rummler amp brache group van tiem three performance level directly aligned three improvement area system process workforce discovered hinton peter reef rummler amp brache group,"['historically', 'even', 'decades', 'attempted', 'reform', 'efforts', 'united', 'states', 'record', 'difficulty', 'fielding', 'weapons', 'schedule', 'hinton', 'keating', 'weisgerber', 'moreover', 'multiple', 'levels', 'air', 'force', 'leadership', 'agreed', 'lengthy', 'acquisitions', 'problem', 'needed', 'fixing', 'air', 'force', 'news', 'service', 'pope', 'review', 'relevant', 'underscored', 'complexity', 'acquisition', 'system', 'outlined', 'long', 'history', 'reform', 'initiatives', 'highlighted', 'recommendations', 'literature', 'addressed', 'problem', 'unnecessary', 'delays', 'acquisition', 'impeded', 'delivery', 'needs', 'capabilities', 'resulting', 'impacts', 'mission', 'used', 'performance', 'performance', 'technology', 'hpt', 'model', 'roadmap', 'framed', 'three', 'performance', 'levels', 'organization', 'process', 'performer', 'described', 'rummler', 'brache', 'rummler', 'amp', 'brache', 'group', 'van', 'tiem', 'three', 'performance', 'levels', 'directly', 'aligned', 'three', 'improvement', 'areas', 'system', 'process', 'workforce', 'discovered', 'hinton', 'peters', 'reeves', 'rummler', 'amp', 'brache', 'group']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Correlating Leadership Styles to Job Satisfaction in the U.S. Army’s Parachute Rigger Community,"The study examined the relationships between leadership styles, specifically transformational and transactional leadership, and job satisfaction within the rigger community in the U.S. Army. The data were collected using The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) and The Job Descriptive Index (JDI) surveys. The research sought to understand how leadership styles impact job satisfaction and utilized Spearman and Pearson correlations for analysis, exploring attributes that assist in identification of transformational and transactional leadership styles in the military in relation to achieving desired outcomes and results. The purpose of this quantitative research was to examine the relationships between Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) leadership ratings for supervisors of parachute riggers instructors and Job Description Index (JDI) satisfaction ratings within the parachute rigger community. Survey responses from 37 U.S. Army parachute riggers instructors in the Quartermaster Schoolhouse in Fort Lee, Virginia, Aerial Delivery &amp; Field Services Department (ADFSD) and Aerial Delivery Division were used. Lack of research regarding leadership styles within the parachute rigger community was addressed. Noncommissioned officer instructors completed the MLQ and JDI. Research strongly linked leadership styles and job satisfaction. Supervision had the highest positive correlation in both transformational and transactional leadership, except for Opportunities for Promotion, which showed the lowest correlation. These results could be used by senior leaders in the U.S. Army to reengineer, transform, and develop better soldiers by addressing both leadership styles and their effectiveness. They may impact social change by increasing the amount of attention given to the development of individuals and groups within the U.S. Army by their advisors and instructors to create better-trained soldiers.",2900126846,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Hunter, Angela J.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2023," Job Descriptive Index , Job satisfaction , Leadership , Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire , Transactional leadership , Transformational leadership", 9798381113983,,, English, English,,,,2023,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2023,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/correlating-leadership-styles-job-satisfaction-u/docview/2900126846/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Correlating+Leadership+Styles+to+Job+Satisfaction+in+the+U.S.+Army%E2%80%99s+Parachute+Rigger+Community&amp;issn=&amp;date=2023-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hunter%2C+Angela+J.&amp;isbn=9798381113983&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",examined relationship leadership style specifically transformational transactional leadership job satisfaction within rigger community army collected using multifactor leadership questionnaire mlq job descriptive index jdi survey sought understand leadership style impact job satisfaction utilized spearman pearson correlation exploring attribute assist identification transformational transactional leadership style relation achieving desired outcome result purpose quantitative examine relationship multifactor leadership questionnaire mlq leadership rating supervisor parachute rigger instructor job description index jdi satisfaction rating within parachute rigger community survey response army parachute rigger instructor quartermaster schoolhouse fort lee virginia aerial delivery amp field service adfsd aerial delivery division used lack regarding leadership style within parachute rigger community addressed noncommissioned officer instructor completed mlq jdi strongly linked leadership style job satisfaction supervision highest positive correlation transformational transactional leadership except opportunity promotion showed lowest correlation result could used senior leader army reengineer transform develop better soldier addressing leadership style effectiveness may impact social change increasing amount attention given development individual group within army advisor instructor create soldier,"['examined', 'relationships', 'leadership', 'styles', 'specifically', 'transformational', 'transactional', 'leadership', 'job', 'satisfaction', 'within', 'rigger', 'community', 'army', 'data', 'collected', 'using', 'multifactor', 'leadership', 'questionnaire', 'mlq', 'job', 'descriptive', 'index', 'jdi', 'surveys', 'sought', 'understand', 'leadership', 'styles', 'impact', 'job', 'satisfaction', 'utilized', 'spearman', 'pearson', 'correlations', 'exploring', 'attributes', 'assist', 'identification', 'transformational', 'transactional', 'leadership', 'styles', 'relation', 'achieving', 'desired', 'outcomes', 'results', 'purpose', 'quantitative', 'examine', 'relationships', 'multifactor', 'leadership', 'questionnaire', 'mlq', 'leadership', 'ratings', 'supervisors', 'parachute', 'riggers', 'instructors', 'job', 'description', 'index', 'jdi', 'satisfaction', 'ratings', 'within', 'parachute', 'rigger', 'community', 'survey', 'responses', 'army', 'parachute', 'riggers', 'instructors', 'quartermaster', 'schoolhouse', 'fort', 'lee', 'virginia', 'aerial', 'delivery', 'amp', 'field', 'services', 'adfsd', 'aerial', 'delivery', 'division', 'used', 'lack', 'regarding', 'leadership', 'styles', 'within', 'parachute', 'rigger', 'community', 'addressed', 'noncommissioned', 'officer', 'instructors', 'completed', 'mlq', 'jdi', 'strongly', 'linked', 'leadership', 'styles', 'job', 'satisfaction', 'supervision', 'highest', 'positive', 'correlation', 'transformational', 'transactional', 'leadership', 'except', 'opportunities', 'promotion', 'showed', 'lowest', 'correlation', 'results', 'could', 'used', 'senior', 'leaders', 'army', 'reengineer', 'transform', 'develop', 'better', 'soldiers', 'addressing', 'leadership', 'styles', 'effectiveness', 'may', 'impact', 'social', 'change', 'increasing', 'amount', 'attention', 'given', 'development', 'individuals', 'groups', 'within', 'army', 'advisors', 'instructors', 'create', 'soldiers']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Designing Doctrine Between Failures: The Role Knowledge Creation Plays in Organizational Learning When the Environment is Complex,"Despite the many studies looking into how knowledge is created by organizations (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; Argote, 1999), the literature suffers from three major limitations. First, much of it is a-contextual in that it is written as if organizational learning can be generalized across different contexts. Second, the literature assumes linearity-- that is, that the process of learning follows a linear path from experience to knowledge gain to learning. Last, the current literature does not sufficiently cover the role sensemaking plays in the process of turning experiences into knowledge, especially in mega bureaucracies within complex environments. This dissertation seeks to inquire into the processes through which organizations learn when those organizations are very large public organizations operating in complex environments. There are challenges with learning for any organization, but I argue these challenges are unique in these examples. Specifically, this research will focus on the codification of knowledge with respect to organizational learning, called doctrine in some professions. Thus, this dissertation will focus on the role doctrine plays in various circumstances within a large, public organization involved in complex situations. The U.S. Army is an information-rich case of just such an organization. The Army codifies its knowledge in the form of what it calls “doctrine.” For the purposes of this dissertation, a mega-bureaucracy is defined as a rules-following organization that is relatively large compared with others. The Army is also a public organization and one involved in complex situations. The process by which the Army turns its experiences into knowledge and thus, in theory, learns from those experiences, potentially provides insights into the nuances of public organizations and their learning process. This dissertation examined how the U.S. Army constructed knowledge during the height of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars using a hermeneutical method. The study qualitatively analyzed U.S. Army doctrine from the 1990s to 2019 that dealt with the U.S. Army’s operations process. Specifically, this research addressed the question of what role doctrine plays in the knowledge creation process of a mega-bureaucracy like the U.S. Army. This research’s major findings were, 1) espoused knowledge in mega bureaucracies is dynamic and responsive to perceived or real complex environmental change, 2) espoused knowledge development in mega bureaucracies can be non-linear and may be iterative as changes become mixed with and/or co-opted by older thinking, and 3) due to the dynamic interaction of old and new thinking, espoused knowledge in mega-bureaucracies can be contradictory in terms of mis-aligning ontological, epistemological and methodological beliefs and approaches. This makes knowledge creation part of a host of actions that a mega-bureaucracy might undertake. Some of these actions might be to look like they are doing something. Others to secure resources. Still others attempt to apply different, even potentially better methods. The bottom line is that they are part of a set of complex reactions to the perceived new environment, not simply part of a linear process of rational learning. They are also likely to be at least partially, if not highly contingent on the specific context. I found within the data signs of a cycle with respect to knowledge creation: of searching for new ideas to address a complex situation followed by a co-option of the new ideas into older ideas, and finally, a resolution that can include a return to the status quo due to the inherent cultural dominance of an organization’s preexisting ontology.",2890694547,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Martin, Grant

Characteristics of Non-benzodiazepine Sedative Hypnotic Use Among Combat Injured U.S. Service Members With Insomnia,"Objectives: There are currently no military studies on non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotic (n-BSH) use among combat injured active-duty service members. There were three objectives of this dissertation: (1) describe rates and patterns of n-BSH medications in this population; (2) examine how n-BSH use affects perceived Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL); and (3) examine the role of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in n-BSH prescription patterns among these injured service members. Methods: Three population-based retrospective studies were conducted on all U.S. service members who sustained injuries during deployed operations between September 2001 and Aug 2019 and who received pharmacological treatment for insomnia. These studies utilized six data sources from the Department of Defense (DoD); the Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database (EMED), Military Health System Data Repository (MDR), Pharmacy Data Transaction System (PDTS), Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Career History Archival Medical and Personnel System (CHAMPS), and the Wounded Warrior Recovery Project (WWRP). DMDC and EMED contains deployment and combat information for Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. Classification of injury, TBI status, n-BSH prescription patterns, and clinical diagnoses (assessed via ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes) were abstracted from the MDR and PDTS. Mental and physical wellbeing questionnaires from the WWRP were utilized to assess health related quality of life (HRQOL). Results: n-BSHs were the most frequently prescribed medication class among service members who sustained combat injuries. Long-term prescriptions were largely driving the high prevalence rates of n-BSH, given that 42.6% of service members were prescribed n-BSHs for 6 months or longer. Additionally, they experienced high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (50.6%), TBI (42.5%), depression (39.1%), anxiety (52.0%), and chronic pain (15.1%). After adjustment, there was no statistically significant relationship between n-BSH prescription characteristics with service members’ HRQOL, or between TBI and n-BSH prescription characteristics. Conclusions: Combat injured service members’ n-BSH prescription patterns exceed Food and Drug Administration and American College of Physician guidelines. While n-BSH patterns did not differ by TBI or HRQOL, the high prevalence of long-term n-BSHs is alarming. Given their high prevalence of comorbid conditions in this population, clinical management of these service members should include a multidisciplinary approach.",2839590300,,,Dissertations &

Knowledge Management Implementation in U.S. Army Headquarters: A Case Study,"This case study examined the U.S. Army’s implementation of knowledge management (KM) as an integrating process within its command and control system. The research problem explored was the U.S. Army’s attempts to measure knowledge transfer using the KM Maturity Model (KM3) and KM Assessment Tool (KMAT). The purpose was to determine levels of KM maturity and knowledge barriers that affected decision-making. The conceptual approach used Nonaka and Takeuchi’s process theory for the knowledgebased firm, combined with Argote and Hora’s framework of knowledge transfer as it applied to Moore’s concept of public value. The central research questions explored the levels of KM maturity for U.S. Army headquarters and how their staff elements described knowledge transfer barriers. This study used a qualitative single case study design with eight embedded units of analysis. Analysis of archival data from the KM3 found that the average KM maturity level of the units of analysis indicated that some processes were repeatable but unlikely to be rigorous. Thematic analysis of archival data from the KMAT revealed four major knowledge transfer barriers: content management, personnel turnover, portal use, and anchoring KM in institutional governance. The findings may be used by the military to guide positive social change in its occupational structure, personnel management, training, KM policy, and technological approaches to content management. These changes, if instituted, may also enhance future decision-making by senior Army leaders, leading to efficient commitment of public resources.",2838122663,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Van Laar, David M.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2023," Army headquarters , Knowledge barriers , Knowledge management , Knowledge transfer , Process theory", 9798379912710,,, English, English,,,,2023,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2023,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/knowledge-management-implementation-u-s-army/docview/2838122663/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Knowledge+Management+Implementation+in+U.S.+Army+Headquarters%3A+A+Case+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2023-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Van+Laar%2C+David+M.&amp;isbn=9798379912710&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest One Academic, Worldwide Political Science Abstracts",case examined army implementation knowledge management integrating process within command control system problem explored army attempt measure knowledge transfer using maturity model assessment tool kmat purpose determine level maturity knowledge barrier affected conceptual used nonaka takeuchi process theory knowledgebased firm combined argote hora framework knowledge transfer applied moore concept public value central question explored level maturity army headquarters staff element described knowledge transfer barrier used qualitative single case design eight embedded unit archival found average maturity level unit indicated process repeatable unlikely rigorous thematic archival kmat revealed four major knowledge transfer barrier content management personnel turnover portal use anchoring institutional governance finding may used guide positive social change occupational structure personnel management training policy technological approach content management change instituted may also enhance future senior army leader leading efficient commitment public resource,"['case', 'examined', 'army', 'implementation', 'knowledge', 'management', 'integrating', 'process', 'within', 'command', 'control', 'system', 'problem', 'explored', 'army', 'attempts', 'measure', 'knowledge', 'transfer', 'using', 'maturity', 'model', 'assessment', 'tool', 'kmat', 'purpose', 'determine', 'levels', 'maturity', 'knowledge', 'barriers', 'affected', 'conceptual', 'used', 'nonaka', 'takeuchi', 'process', 'theory', 'knowledgebased', 'firm', 'combined', 'argote', 'hora', 'framework', 'knowledge', 'transfer', 'applied', 'moore', 'concept', 'public', 'value', 'central', 'questions', 'explored', 'levels', 'maturity', 'army', 'headquarters', 'staff', 'elements', 'described', 'knowledge', 'transfer', 'barriers', 'used', 'qualitative', 'single', 'case', 'design', 'eight', 'embedded', 'units', 'archival', 'data', 'found', 'average', 'maturity', 'level', 'units', 'indicated', 'processes', 'repeatable', 'unlikely', 'rigorous', 'thematic', 'archival', 'data', 'kmat', 'revealed', 'four', 'major', 'knowledge', 'transfer', 'barriers', 'content', 'management', 'personnel', 'turnover', 'portal', 'use', 'anchoring', 'institutional', 'governance', 'findings', 'may', 'used', 'guide', 'positive', 'social', 'change', 'occupational', 'structure', 'personnel', 'management', 'training', 'policy', 'technological', 'approaches', 'content', 'management', 'changes', 'instituted', 'may', 'also', 'enhance', 'future', 'senior', 'army', 'leaders', 'leading', 'efficient', 'commitment', 'public', 'resources']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Process Improvement
Project Teams’ Dynamics and Morale: An Exploration of Impacts of Pandemic Adaptation in a Segment of the U.S. Navy,"In March 2020, the world went into lockdown, attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic; organizations around the globe transitioned into virtual and hybrid environments. This exploratory qualitative study highlights the impacts on DoD civilian project teams’ morale and dynamics as they navigated changing workplace landscapes caused by the pandemic. The opportunity was to expand research focused on project teams’ dynamics and morale by exploring the effect of telecommuting and the hybrid work environment. Critical aspects of the literature review included project management, emotional intelligence, morale, team dynamics, and telework. Eight project team members from the U.S. Navy participated in a virtual focus group. Data analyses revealed five primary themes and six subthemes. The primary themes identified in this study included: (a) positive team dynamics associated with the hybrid environment, (b) adverse effects of the hybrid experience on morale, (c) negative perspectives of leveraging the hybrid environment as a tool, (d) negative aspects of team dynamics in the hybrid environment, and (e) positive impacts of the hybrid environment. Flexibility stole the spotlight, followed by the hybrid environments’ adverse effects on morale and the positive and negative impact on team dynamics. The findings of this study lead to implications and potential recommendations for management, including a call to increase flexibility to increase morale and decrease attrition rates, lean into intrinsic motivation, and embrace the hybrid environment. Recommendations included comparing the different PEO IWS directorates, then PEO IWS to other PEOs within NAVSEA, and opening the aperture to compare experiences.",2823323285,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"McKalip, Layla R.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2023," Hybrid workplace , Morale , Project management , Project teams , Team dynamics , Pandemic adaptation", 9798379682354,,, English, English,,,,2023,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2023,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/project-teams-dynamics-morale-exploration-impacts/docview/2823323285/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Project+Teams%E2%80%99+Dynamics+and+Morale%3A+An+Exploration+of+Impacts+of+Pandemic+Adaptation+in+a+Segment+of+the+U.S.+Navy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2023-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McKalip%2C+Layla+R.&amp;isbn=9798379682354&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,march world went lockdown attributed pandemic organization around globe transitioned virtual hybrid environment exploratory qualitative highlight impact civilian project team morale dynamic navigated changing workplace landscape caused pandemic opportunity expand focused project team dynamic morale exploring effect telecommuting hybrid work environment critical aspect literature review included project management emotional intelligence morale team dynamic telework eight project team member navy participated virtual focus group analysis revealed five primary theme six subthemes primary theme identified included positive team dynamic associated hybrid environment adverse effect hybrid experience morale negative perspective leveraging hybrid environment tool negative aspect team dynamic hybrid environment positive impact hybrid environment flexibility stole spotlight followed hybrid environment adverse effect morale positive negative impact team dynamic finding lead implication potential recommendation management including call increase flexibility increase morale decrease attrition rate lean intrinsic motivation embrace hybrid environment recommendation included comparing different peo iw directorate peo iw peos within navsea opening aperture compare experience,"['march', 'world', 'went', 'lockdown', 'attributed', 'pandemic', 'organizations', 'around', 'globe', 'transitioned', 'virtual', 'hybrid', 'environments', 'exploratory', 'qualitative', 'highlights', 'impacts', 'civilian', 'project', 'teams', 'morale', 'dynamics', 'navigated', 'changing', 'workplace', 'landscapes', 'caused', 'pandemic', 'opportunity', 'expand', 'focused', 'project', 'teams', 'dynamics', 'morale', 'exploring', 'effect', 'telecommuting', 'hybrid', 'work', 'environment', 'critical', 'aspects', 'literature', 'review', 'included', 'project', 'management', 'emotional', 'intelligence', 'morale', 'team', 'dynamics', 'telework', 'eight', 'project', 'team', 'members', 'navy', 'participated', 'virtual', 'focus', 'group', 'data', 'analyses', 'revealed', 'five', 'primary', 'themes', 'six', 'subthemes', 'primary', 'themes', 'identified', 'included', 'positive', 'team', 'dynamics', 'associated', 'hybrid', 'environment', 'adverse', 'effects', 'hybrid', 'experience', 'morale', 'negative', 'perspectives', 'leveraging', 'hybrid', 'environment', 'tool', 'negative', 'aspects', 'team', 'dynamics', 'hybrid', 'environment', 'positive', 'impacts', 'hybrid', 'environment', 'flexibility', 'stole', 'spotlight', 'followed', 'hybrid', 'environments', 'adverse', 'effects', 'morale', 'positive', 'negative', 'impact', 'team', 'dynamics', 'findings', 'lead', 'implications', 'potential', 'recommendations', 'management', 'including', 'call', 'increase', 'flexibility', 'increase', 'morale', 'decrease', 'attrition', 'rates', 'lean', 'intrinsic', 'motivation', 'embrace', 'hybrid', 'environment', 'recommendations', 'included', 'comparing', 'different', 'peo', 'iws', 'directorates', 'peo', 'iws', 'peos', 'within', 'navsea', 'opening', 'aperture', 'compare', 'experiences']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
Characteristics of Non-Benzodiazepine Sedative Hypnotic Use Among Combat Injured U.S. Service Members with Insomnia,"Objectives: There are currently no military studies on non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotic (nBSH) use among combat injured active-duty service members. There were three objectives of this dissertation: (1) describe rates and patterns of n-BSH medications in this population; (2) examine how duration of n-BSH use affects perceived Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL); and (3) examine the role of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in n-BSH prescription patterns among these injured service members. Methods: Three population-based retrospective studies were conducted on all U.S. service members who sustained injuries during deployed operations between September 2001 and Aug 2019 and who received pharmacological treatment for insomnia. These studies utilized six data sources from the Department of Defense (DoD); the Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database (EMED), Military Health System Data Repository (MDR), Pharmacy Data Transaction System (PDTS), Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Career History Archival Medical and Personnel System (CHAMPS), and the Wounded Warrior Recovery Project (WWRP). DMDC and EMED contains deployment and combat information for Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. Classification of injury, TBI status, n-BSH prescription patterns, and clinical diagnoses were abstracted from the MDR and PDTS. Mental and physical wellbeing questionnaires from the WWRP were utilized to assess health related quality of life (HRQOL). Results: n-BSHs were the most frequently prescribed medication class among service members who sustained combat injuries. Long-term prescriptions were largely driving the high prevalence rates of n-BSH, given that 42.6% of service members were prescribed n-BSHs for 6 months or longer. Additionally, they experienced high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (50.6%), TBI (42.5%), depression (39.1%), anxiety (52.0%), and chronic pain (15.1%). After adjustment, there was no statistically significant relationship between n-BSH prescription characteristics with service members’ HRQOL, or between TBI and n-BSH prescription characteristics. Conclusions: Combat injured service members’ n-BSH prescription patterns exceed Food and Drug Administration and American College of Physician guidelines. While n-BSH patterns did not differ by TBI or HRQOL, the high prevalence of long-term n-BSHs is alarming and given the high prevalence of comorbid conditions in this population, clinical management of these service members should include a multidisciplinary approach.",2819173018,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Crouch, Daniel Joseph",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright

Engineering Management Tool for Minimizing Errors and Costs in Diagnosing PTSD in Veterans,"As of 2020, the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs reported that 11 to 20% of Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom, 12% of Gulf War, and 15% of Vietnam veterans have been diagnosed with PostTraumatic Stress Disorder. However, misdiagnosis rates have also been of concern due to the complexities of comorbidities (such as Traumatic Brain Injury and depression) with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, the subjective nature of clinician assessments and patients’ self-reporting of symptoms, and the numerous other limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. Patient self-diagnosis rates of the mental disorder have been found to be 20-fold higher than diagnoses using clinician-administered instruments and methods. Furthermore, many health organizations continue to struggle with diagnostic safety due to the lack of available methods to reliably detect, define, measure, and mitigate diagnostic errors. Reducing defective diagnoses is an example of Lean Engineering management of “waste” (e.g., systems or processes that are defective, costly, and/or time-consuming). This praxis demonstrated how using a Lean automation tool, such as an AI classifier, for clinical decision support can generate efficiencies and mitigate Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder diagnosis errors and expenses, thereby reducing waste.",2748456193,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Le, Jacqueline",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2023," Artificial intelligence , Health engineering , Lean engineering , Machine learning , Post-traumatic stress disorder", 9798358486072,,, English, English,,,,2023,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2023,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/engineering-management-tool-minimizing-errors/docview/2748456193/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Engineering+Management+Tool+for+Minimizing+Errors+and+Costs+in+Diagnosing+PTSD+in+Veterans&amp;issn=&amp;date=2023-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Le%2C+Jacqueline&amp;isbn=9798358486072&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,veteran affair reported operation iraqi enduring freedom gulf war vietnam veteran diagnosed posttraumatic stress disorder however misdiagnosis rate also concern due complexity comorbidities traumatic brain injury depression stress disorder subjective nature clinician assessment patient symptom numerous limitation traditional diagnostic method patient rate mental disorder found higher diagnosis using instrument method furthermore many health organization continue struggle diagnostic safety due lack available method reliably detect define measure mitigate diagnostic error reducing defective diagnosis example lean engineering management waste system process defective costly praxis demonstrated using lean automation tool classifier clinical decision support generate efficiency mitigate stress disorder diagnosis error expense thereby reducing waste,"['veterans', 'affairs', 'reported', 'operation', 'iraqi', 'enduring', 'freedom', 'gulf', 'war', 'vietnam', 'veterans', 'diagnosed', 'posttraumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'however', 'misdiagnosis', 'rates', 'also', 'concern', 'due', 'complexities', 'comorbidities', 'traumatic', 'brain', 'injury', 'depression', 'stress', 'disorder', 'subjective', 'nature', 'clinician', 'assessments', 'patients', 'symptoms', 'numerous', 'limitations', 'traditional', 'diagnostic', 'methods', 'patient', 'rates', 'mental', 'disorder', 'found', 'higher', 'diagnoses', 'using', 'instruments', 'methods', 'furthermore', 'many', 'health', 'organizations', 'continue', 'struggle', 'diagnostic', 'safety', 'due', 'lack', 'available', 'methods', 'reliably', 'detect', 'define', 'measure', 'mitigate', 'diagnostic', 'errors', 'reducing', 'defective', 'diagnoses', 'example', 'lean', 'engineering', 'management', 'waste', 'systems', 'processes', 'defective', 'costly', 'praxis', 'demonstrated', 'using', 'lean', 'automation', 'tool', 'classifier', 'clinical', 'decision', 'support', 'generate', 'efficiencies', 'mitigate', 'stress', 'disorder', 'diagnosis', 'errors', 'expenses', 'thereby', 'reducing', 'waste']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement
Improving Depot Repair Lead Time Using Lean Six Sigma,"Lean Six Sigma is a well-known methodology used by manufacturing industries to improve their products and processes, but it is not a methodology that has had much recognition in service-oriented industries. Both industries have the shared goal of providing value to their customers as a mechanism for business competitiveness. One important service industry is Maintenance and Repair, which many private companies are relying on as another opportunity for growth, and many public organizations, such as the Department of Defense, have relied on to sustain highly complex and expensive systems over a longer life cycle than originally planned for. The maintenance and repair service industries are beginning to understand the power that Lean Six Sigma can have in improving their services, yet the current body of knowledge is sparse in comparison to the manufacturing industry. The first objective of this Praxis is to understand what are the current Lean Six Sigma best practices for the Service Industry and then create a Lean Six Sigma Repair model based on those best practices. The second objective is to apply this Lean Six Sigma Repair model to a non-aviation system that requires a core capability for depot-level repairs in order to support the idea that the DoD can benefit from an enterprise-wide Lean Six Sigma Repair model based on service industry best practices. The proposed Lean Six Sigma Repair model is specifically applied to a government depot repair facility experiencing long lead times, work order backlogs, and suboptimal spare inventory levels. This Praxis will help logistics engineering managers resolve problems with the depot-level repair of DoD systems in the Operations &amp; Support Life Cycle Phase. ",2732555346,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Richmond, Ann M.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2023," Lean , Logistics , Maintenance , Repair , Service industry , Six sigma", 9798357531308,,, English, English,,,,2023,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2023,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/improving-depot-repair-lead-time-using-lean-six/docview/2732555346/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Improving+Depot+Repair+Lead+Time+Using+Lean+Six+Sigma&amp;issn=&amp;date=2023-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Richmond%2C+Ann+M.&amp;isbn=9798357531308&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,lean six sigma used manufacturing industry improve product process much recognition industry industry shared goal providing value customer mechanism business competitiveness one important service industry maintenance repair many private company relying another opportunity growth many public organization relied sustain highly complex expensive system longer life cycle originally planned maintenance repair service industry beginning understand power lean six sigma improving service yet current body knowledge sparse comparison manufacturing industry first objective praxis understand current lean six sigma best practice service industry create lean six sigma repair model based best practice second objective apply lean six sigma repair model system requires core capability repair order support idea benefit lean six sigma repair model based service industry best practice proposed lean six sigma repair model specifically applied government depot repair facility experiencing long lead time work order backlog suboptimal spare inventory level praxis help logistics engineering manager resolve problem repair system operation amp support life cycle phase,"['lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'used', 'manufacturing', 'industries', 'improve', 'products', 'processes', 'much', 'recognition', 'industries', 'industries', 'shared', 'goal', 'providing', 'value', 'customers', 'mechanism', 'business', 'competitiveness', 'one', 'important', 'service', 'industry', 'maintenance', 'repair', 'many', 'private', 'companies', 'relying', 'another', 'opportunity', 'growth', 'many', 'public', 'organizations', 'relied', 'sustain', 'highly', 'complex', 'expensive', 'systems', 'longer', 'life', 'cycle', 'originally', 'planned', 'maintenance', 'repair', 'service', 'industries', 'beginning', 'understand', 'power', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'improving', 'services', 'yet', 'current', 'body', 'knowledge', 'sparse', 'comparison', 'manufacturing', 'industry', 'first', 'objective', 'praxis', 'understand', 'current', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'best', 'practices', 'service', 'industry', 'create', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'repair', 'model', 'based', 'best', 'practices', 'second', 'objective', 'apply', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'repair', 'model', 'system', 'requires', 'core', 'capability', 'repairs', 'order', 'support', 'idea', 'benefit', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'repair', 'model', 'based', 'service', 'industry', 'best', 'practices', 'proposed', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'repair', 'model', 'specifically', 'applied', 'government', 'depot', 'repair', 'facility', 'experiencing', 'long', 'lead', 'times', 'work', 'order', 'backlogs', 'suboptimal', 'spare', 'inventory', 'levels', 'praxis', 'help', 'logistics', 'engineering', 'managers', 'resolve', 'problems', 'repair', 'systems', 'operations', 'amp', 'support', 'life', 'cycle', 'phase']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement

The instructor was Patrick Lynch of Lynch Consultants, LLC. Lynch was accompanied by USMC COL (Ret) David Clifton. Lynch began his presentation with a definition of ""The Total Force"". In the past, the total force was defined as the active duty component, the reserve and National Guard components, and the civilian component. However, today the total force consists of the uniformed personnel, the civilian personnel, and the dedicated contractors or consultants. He notes that this change is a reality of what the Department of Defense is today, and to make it work we need to ensure this is a functional relationship between the consultants and the consumers.",3060835278,,,Trade Journals,,"Snell, Michael V",, Department of Defense, Copyright American Society of Military Comptrollers Summer 2022,,, Commentary,, Summer 2022,,,0004-2188,3.0, English, English,, 50-52, Alexandria,Summer 2022,The Armed Forces Comptroller,2022,,67.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/good-bad-ugly-service-contracting/docview/3060835278/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aaccounting&amp;atitle=The+Good%2C+the+Bad%2C+and+the+Ugly+%28of+Service+Contracting%29&amp;title=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;issn=00042188&amp;date=2022-07-01&amp;volume=67&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=50&amp;au=Snell%2C+Michael+V&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",snell discusses workshop good bad ugly service contracting asmc pdi atlanta instructor patrick lynch lynch consultant llc lynch accompanied usmc col ret david clifton lynch began presentation definition total force past total force defined active duty component reserve national guard component civilian component however today total force consists uniformed personnel civilian personnel dedicated contractor consultant note change reality today make work need ensure functional relationship consultant consumer,"['snell', 'discusses', 'workshop', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'service', 'contracting', 'asmc', 'pdi', 'atlanta', 'instructor', 'patrick', 'lynch', 'lynch', 'consultants', 'llc', 'lynch', 'accompanied', 'usmc', 'col', 'ret', 'david', 'clifton', 'lynch', 'began', 'presentation', 'definition', 'total', 'force', 'past', 'total', 'force', 'defined', 'active', 'duty', 'component', 'reserve', 'national', 'guard', 'components', 'civilian', 'component', 'however', 'today', 'total', 'force', 'consists', 'uniformed', 'personnel', 'civilian', 'personnel', 'dedicated', 'contractors', 'consultants', 'notes', 'change', 'reality', 'today', 'make', 'work', 'need', 'ensure', 'functional', 'relationship', 'consultants', 'consumers']",Commentary,0,Management and Leadership

The U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Soldier Center conducted multiple touch points in fiscal year 2021 through its Measuring and Advancing Soldier Tactical Readiness and Effectiveness (MASTR-E) program, which uses various field simulations to collect human performance data and inform operational outcomes. Given that the ATB is a tactical rather than sportswear item, it will need to integrate well with equipment and body armor, providing enhanced protection and performance in addition to an ideal fit. Understanding that sports brassieres incorporate various structural elements as they increase or decrease in sizing, final results from the studies will inform [the Program Executive Office for] Soldier and ultimately the Army Uniform Board, so that a determination can be made on the Army's path forward for best equipping female Soldiers for their missions.""",2653350942,,,Trade Journals,,"Thompson, Maureena",, Army Futures Command, Copyright Superintendent of Documents Spring 2022,,, General Information,, Spring 2022," Somatosensory system , Combat readiness , Sensor , Soldier",,1529-8507,, English, English,, 20-23, Fort Belvoir,Spring 2022,Army AL & T,2022,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/essential-role-soldier-touch-points/docview/2653350942/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amilitary&amp;atitle=THE+ESSENTIAL+ROLE+OF+SOLDIER+TOUCH+POINTS&amp;title=Army+AL+%26+T&amp;issn=15298507&amp;date=2022-04-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=20&amp;au=Thompson%2C+Maureena&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Army+AL+%26+T&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",vast majority soldier would thrilled part program said chief warrant officer matthew pfannerstill member field artillery brigade participated live fire exercise soldier touch point grafenwoehr training area germany army combat capability development command devcom soldier center conducted multiple touch point fiscal year measuring advancing soldier tactical readiness effectiveness program us various field simulation collect human performance inform operational outcome given atb tactical rather sportswear item need integrate well equipment body armor providing enhanced protection performance addition ideal fit understanding sport brassiere incorporate various structural element increase decrease sizing final result study inform program executive office soldier ultimately army uniform board determination made army path forward best equipping female soldier mission,"['vast', 'majority', 'soldiers', 'would', 'thrilled', 'part', 'program', 'said', 'chief', 'warrant', 'officer', 'matthew', 'pfannerstill', 'member', 'field', 'artillery', 'brigade', 'participated', 'live', 'fire', 'exercise', 'soldier', 'touch', 'point', 'grafenwoehr', 'training', 'area', 'germany', 'army', 'combat', 'capabilities', 'development', 'command', 'devcom', 'soldier', 'center', 'conducted', 'multiple', 'touch', 'points', 'fiscal', 'year', 'measuring', 'advancing', 'soldier', 'tactical', 'readiness', 'effectiveness', 'program', 'uses', 'various', 'field', 'simulations', 'collect', 'human', 'performance', 'data', 'inform', 'operational', 'outcomes', 'given', 'atb', 'tactical', 'rather', 'sportswear', 'item', 'need', 'integrate', 'well', 'equipment', 'body', 'armor', 'providing', 'enhanced', 'protection', 'performance', 'addition', 'ideal', 'fit', 'understanding', 'sports', 'brassieres', 'incorporate', 'various', 'structural', 'elements', 'increase', 'decrease', 'sizing', 'final', 'results', 'studies', 'inform', 'program', 'executive', 'office', 'soldier', 'ultimately', 'army', 'uniform', 'board', 'determination', 'made', 'army', 'path', 'forward', 'best', 'equipping', 'female', 'soldiers', 'missions']",General Information,3,Management and Leadership
Developments in high-resolution mass spectrometric analyses of new psychoactive substances,"The proliferation of new psychoactive substances (NPS) has necessitated the development and improvement of current practices for the detection and identification of known NPS and newly emerging derivatives. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is quickly becoming the industry standard for these analyses due to its ability to be operated in data-independent acquisition (DIA) modes, allowing for the collection of large amounts of data and enabling retrospective data interrogation as new information becomes available. The increasing popularity of HRMS has also prompted the exploration of new ways to screen for NPS, including broad-spectrum wastewater analysis to identify usage trends in the community and metabolomic-based approaches to examine the effects of drugs of abuse on endogenous compounds. In this paper, the novel applications of HRMS techniques to the analysis of NPS is reviewed.

Evaluation of Analysis Methods in Mass Spectrometry Based Proteomics,"Mass spectrometry (MS) has become indispensable in proteomics and is routinely used in biomarker discovery, on which the foundation of personalised medicine is built. Effective MS analysis relies on sophisticated software tools capable of processing large quantities of complex data. As such, constant improvement of MS data analysis pipelines is essential to keep up with advances in MS capabilities. Data independent analysis (DIA) is favourable in discovery proteomics due to the unbiased fragmentation of all peptides, reportedly improving reproducibility. SWATH MS, SONAR and HDMSe are among the best DIA MS methods available for proteomic biomarker discovery. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of MS pipelines inclusive of software tools commonly used in conjunction with these DIA MS methods, here we conduct a comparative analysis on a range of proteomic data sets. An initial comparison between SWATH MS data processed with OpenSWATH (OS) and HDMSe data processed with Progenesis QI P (PQIP) was conducted on serum samples, the predominant sample type used in biomarker studies. Data processing methods were found to significantly influence outcomes, in particular the ion accounting identification method used in PQIP reports fewer missing values (missingness) than the OS pipeline, which is beneficial in biomarker discovery to achieve comprehensive differential expression analysis. Serum samples typically have low proteins yields in MS analysis due to the large dynamic range of the plasma proteome, therefore a secondary comparison was conducted on cell lines. Cell lines were processed using SWATH MS with OS, SONAR with PQIP, and HDMSe with PQIP. In absence of a universal processing method, SONAR with PQIP was used to provide insights into whether differences seen between SWATH MS with OS and HDMSe with PQIP related to the MS or processing method. Findings substantiated evidence that the PQIP ion accounting method is better able to alleviate missingness. Other findings highlighted differences between outcomes in HDMSe and SONAR that are likely attributed to advances in the SONAR MS method. Finally, developments to the SWATH MS with OS pipeline were tested by comparing a novel multi-library approach to the standard single library method, along with a new machine learning element to replace standard p-value based expression analysis in order to determine which of the methods offers the most valuable insights for candidate biomarker discovery. Combining multiple libraries using z-scores increased the number of total proteins quantified and those significantly differentially expressed, providing higher predictive power for the potential biomarker panels. Throughout this research the choice of processing methods were found to significantly impact the interpretation of data and final results. As such, further efforts into improving reproducibility across the field are needed.",2861185199,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Arthur, Caitlin S.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not

A Qualitative Intrinsic Case Study Exploring the Effectiveness of Instructor Upgrade Training among Air National Guard Air Battle Managers,"At the 128 th Air Control Squadron, a Control and Reporting Center (CRC) within the Wisconsin Air National Guard, Air Battle Manager (ABM) instructors struggle with the fundamentals of serving in a teaching role. Most notably, during the unit’s last deployment in support of operations in the skies over Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan, a common deficiency in instructor proficiency was noted between the Air National Guard (ANG) and their Active Duty counterparts while deployed in a joint operational environment. This observation led to the implementation of this study and examination of all possibilities of a deficiency in either overall training standards or requirements for the Air National Guard’s Instructor Upgrade (IUP) training program. The focus of this study was to identify the most significant areas of struggle Air National Guard ABM instructors experience and, more importantly, gain a better understanding of their perceptions toward the overall effectiveness of the current IUP training program. To uncover areas for growth in the current training, the researcher utilized a qualitative intrinsic case study in a three-phased approach of analyzing artifacts and conducting both observations and semi-structured interviews. The researcher rooted this study methodology and design in a theoretical framework most closely associated with social constructivism and andragogical principles of adult learning. The researcher of this study has carefully vetted all information contained within this research to ensure no information designated as For Official Use Only (FOUO) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is reported. Specific numbers and specific training course names, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to the ABM career field and training program are rough estimates and do not disclose the exact training undergone by U.S. Air Force Air Battle Managers.

Intervenciones basadas en métodos de relajación en el contexto escolar desde la perspectiva de la promoción de la salud y el bienestar: una revisión sistemática (Relaxation methods based interventions in a school context from a perspective of health and w,"Nowadays, children's daily lives are full of stressful elements that they have to deal with. As a practice of body mediation, relaxation privileges awareness and tonic-emotional regulation and comprises different techniques that reduce the impact of stress negative effects on the developing brain. This study aimed to identify and characterise school interventions based on relaxation methods for pre-school and elementary school children to promote health and well-being. It is a systematic literature review based on publications and on terms previously defined. The obtained six papers that make up the corpus of the study went through five filtering steps. The papers were analysed regarding their approach to relaxation, the type of intervention, the techniques used and the results obtained. The results suggest that the concept of relaxation can be used from different perspectives and that relaxation for children promotes the reduction of visible symptoms of anxiety, the improvement of autonomous functions, the child's autonomy and initiative, the interactions with others, the socio-emotional development and short-term memory development. The interventions based on relaxation methods in a school context/setting, carried out in a universal primary prevention approach, contribute to a health-promoting school favouring the child's integral development and promote life skills.",2699556793,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Sarroeira, Sara;Beatriz Oliveira Pereira;Carvalho, Graça S;Eugenio Rodríguez Fernandéz",,," © 2022.

Sole Sourcing Reliance,"This qualitative research case study investigated the increasing reliance on sole-sourced critical defense components within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) supply chain network. This reliance has resulted in increased risks of operational units not achieving the agency’s minimum operational readiness requirements as presented in the DoD Inspector General’s Top 10 management challenges for the fiscal year 2020. The general problem to be addressed was the increasing reliance on sole-sourcing within the supply chain networks of government agencies and business organizations that have contributed to heightened risks of operational readiness reduction and manufacturing production delays. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore the strategies that some U.S. DoD contract officers use to reduce sole-sourced critical equipment components from the supply chain. The researcher framed research questions to focus on previous cases experienced by former or current U.S. DoD contracting officers. This strategy was implemented to gain their perspective on what factors they believe are contributing to the increasing reliance on sole sources for materials and resources. Eight interviews were conducted using purposeful sampling. The analysis of the interview data yielded three primary themes and seven sub-themes for consideration. The themes developed during this study are pertinent in discussing some potential causation based on their frequency among the eight interviews. The findings were connected to a substantial body of literature from academia, industry media, and DoD policies and procedures. Potential opportunities for improving the general business practices within the DoD and major defense firms were identified.",2695078027,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Stammreich, John S.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2022," Aerospace , Department of Defense , Government , Sourcing , Supply chain", 9798837528552,,, English, English,,,,2022,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2022,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/sole-sourcing-reliance/docview/2695078027/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sole+Sourcing+Reliance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2022-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stammreich%2C+John+S.&amp;isbn=9798837528552&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,qualitative case investigated increasing reliance critical component within supply chain network reliance resulted increased risk operational unit achieving agency minimum operational readiness requirement presented inspector general top management challenge fiscal year general problem addressed increasing reliance within supply chain network government agency business organization contributed heightened risk operational readiness reduction manufacturing production delay purpose qualitative case explore strategy contract officer use reduce critical equipment component supply chain researcher framed question focus previous case experienced former current contracting officer strategy implemented gain perspective factor believe contributing increasing reliance sole source material resource eight interview conducted using purposeful sampling interview yielded three primary theme seven consideration theme developed pertinent discussing potential causation based frequency among eight interview finding connected substantial body literature academia industry medium policy procedure potential opportunity improving general business practice within major firm identified,"['qualitative', 'case', 'investigated', 'increasing', 'reliance', 'critical', 'components', 'within', 'supply', 'chain', 'network', 'reliance', 'resulted', 'increased', 'risks', 'operational', 'units', 'achieving', 'agency', 'minimum', 'operational', 'readiness', 'requirements', 'presented', 'inspector', 'general', 'top', 'management', 'challenges', 'fiscal', 'year', 'general', 'problem', 'addressed', 'increasing', 'reliance', 'within', 'supply', 'chain', 'networks', 'government', 'agencies', 'business', 'organizations', 'contributed', 'heightened', 'risks', 'operational', 'readiness', 'reduction', 'manufacturing', 'production', 'delays', 'purpose', 'qualitative', 'case', 'explore', 'strategies', 'contract', 'officers', 'use', 'reduce', 'critical', 'equipment', 'components', 'supply', 'chain', 'researcher', 'framed', 'questions', 'focus', 'previous', 'cases', 'experienced', 'former', 'current', 'contracting', 'officers', 'strategy', 'implemented', 'gain', 'perspective', 'factors', 'believe', 'contributing', 'increasing', 'reliance', 'sole', 'sources', 'materials', 'resources', 'eight', 'interviews', 'conducted', 'using', 'purposeful', 'sampling', 'interview', 'data', 'yielded', 'three', 'primary', 'themes', 'seven', 'consideration', 'themes', 'developed', 'pertinent', 'discussing', 'potential', 'causation', 'based', 'frequency', 'among', 'eight', 'interviews', 'findings', 'connected', 'substantial', 'body', 'literature', 'academia', 'industry', 'media', 'policies', 'procedures', 'potential', 'opportunities', 'improving', 'general', 'business', 'practices', 'within', 'major', 'firms', 'identified']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
Applying Model-Based Systems Engineering in Search of Quality by Design,"Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and Model-Based Engineering (MBE) techniques have been successfully introduced into the design process of many different types of systems. The application of these techniques can be reflected in the modeling of requirements, functions, behavior, and many other aspects. The modeled design provides a digital representation of a system and the supporting development data architecture and functional requirements associated with that architecture through modeling system aspects. Various levels of the system and the corresponding data architecture fidelity can be represented within MBSE environment tools. Typically, the level of fidelity is driven by crucial systems engineering constraints such as cost, schedule, performance, and quality. Systems engineering uses many methods to develop system and data architecture to provide a representative system that meets costs within schedule with sufficient quality while maintaining the customer performance needs. The most complex and elusive constraints on systems engineering are defining system requirements focusing on quality, given a certain set of system level requirements, which is the likelihood that those requirements will be correctly and accurately found in the final system design. The focus of this research will investigate specifically the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) in use today to establish and then assess the relationship between the system, data architecture, and requirements in terms of Quality By Design (QbD). QbD was first coined in 1992, Quality by Design: The New Steps for Planning Quality into Goods and Services [1].This research investigates and proposes a means to: contextualize high-level quality terms within the MBSE functional area, provide an outline for a conceptual but functional quality framework as it pertains to the MBSE DoDAF, provides tailored quality metrics with improved definitions, and then tests this improved quality framework by assessing two corresponding case studies analysis evaluations within the MBSE functional area to interrogate model architectures and assess quality of system design. Developed in the early 2000s, the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) is still in use today, and its system description methodologies continue to impact subsequent system description approaches [2]. Two case studies were analyzed to show proposed QbD evaluation to analyze DoDAF CONOP architecture quality. The first case study addresses the analysis of DoDAF CONOP of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) ground system for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite system with particular focus on the Stored Mission Data (SMD)mission thread. The second case study addresses the analysis of DoDAF CONOP of the Search and Rescue (SAR) navel rescue operation network System of Systems (SoS) with particular focus on the Command and Control signaling mission thread. The case studies help to demonstrate anew DoDAF Quality Conceptual Framework (DQCF) as a means to investigate quality of DoDAF architecture in depth to include the application of DoDAF standard, the UML/SysML standards, requirement architecture instantiation, as well as modularity to understand architecture reusability and complexity. By providing a renewed focus on a quality-based systems engineering process when applying the DoDAF, improved trust in the system and data architecture of the completed models can be achieved. The results of the case study analyses reveal how a quality-focused systems engineering process can be used during development to provide a product design that better meets the customer’s intent and ultimately provides the potential for the best quality product.",2675659154,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Miller, Andrew R.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the

Pancreatic cancer cells spectral library by DIA-MS and the phenotype analysis of gemcitabine sensitivity,"Data-independent acquisition (DIA)-mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteome strategies are increasingly used for detecting and validating protein biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Here, based on an in-depth proteome analysis of seven pancreatic cancer cell lines, we built a pancreas-specific mass spectrum library containing 10633 protein groups and 184551 peptides. The proteome difference among the seven pancreatic cancer cells was significant, especially for the divergent expression of proteins related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The spectra library was applied to explore the proteome difference of PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells upon gemcitabine (GEM) treatment, and potential GEM targets were identified. The cytotoxicity test and GEM target analysis found that HPAC, CFPAC-1, and BxPC-3 were sensitive to GEM treatment, whereas PANC-1 and AsPC-1 were resistant. Finally, we found EMT was significant for CFPAC-1, AsPC-1, and PANC-1 cells, whereas BxPC-3 and HPAC cells showed more typical epithelial features. This library provides a valuable resource for in-depth proteomic analysis on pancreatic cancer cell lines, meeting the urgent demands for cell line-dependent protein differences and targeted drug analysis.

Staff Hypertension Education Program for Vulnerable Populations in a Primary Care Setting,"For health care practitioners to effectively manage hypertension (HTN) patients and their related long- and short-term consequences, they must first identify the underlying cause of the disease. When patient interventions are not regularly implemented by clinicians, the likelihood of complications from HTN increases. A gap in staff knowledge on managing patients with HTN was identified in an outpatient clinic in the midwestern United States. A staff education program for health care providers to close the knowledge gap was developed based on the most recent Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of HTN. The aim of this project was to explore the impact of an evidence-based staff education program on increasing clinical personnel’s awareness of the management of HTN. The health promotion model played a critical role in guiding the project’s development and implementation. Three expert stakeholders endorsed the project, agreeing that the educational program and content, when applied to clinical practice, would increase staff understanding of the management and diagnosis of HTN. Ten clinical staff members participated in the education program, first completing a pretest questionnaire and then viewing a PowerPoint presentation outlining the educational program’s content. The participants completed posttest questionnaires to assess their knowledge following the PowerPoint presentation. Posttest results suggested that staff knowledge grew due to a learning gain from the program’s original baseline. The project has the potential for positive social change when evidence from the staff education is translated into practice, resulting in improved patient management for the treatment of HTN.",2649525349,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Jobity, Brando",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2022," Staff hypertension education program , Vulnerable populations , Primary care setting", 979-8-209-98840-3,,, English, English,,,,2022,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2022,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/staff-hypertension-education-program-vulnerable/docview/2649525349/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Staff+Hypertension+Education+Program+for+Vulnerable+Populations+in+a+Primary+Care+Setting&amp;issn=&amp;date=2022-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jobity%2C+Brando&amp;isbn=979-8-209-98840-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Health Research Premium Collection, ProQuest One Academic",health care practitioner effectively manage hypertension htn patient related consequence must first identify underlying cause disease patient intervention regularly implemented clinician likelihood complication htn increase gap staff knowledge managing patient htn identified outpatient clinic midwestern united state staff education program health care provider close knowledge gap developed based recent veteran clinical practice guideline management htn aim project explore impact staff education program increasing clinical personnel awareness management htn health promotion model played critical role guiding project development implementation three expert stakeholder endorsed project agreeing educational program content applied clinical practice would increase staff understanding management diagnosis htn ten clinical staff member participated education program first completing pretest questionnaire viewing powerpoint presentation outlining educational program content participant completed posttest questionnaire assess knowledge following powerpoint presentation posttest result suggested staff knowledge grew due learning gain program original baseline project potential positive social change evidence staff education translated practice resulting improved patient management treatment htn,"['health', 'care', 'practitioners', 'effectively', 'manage', 'hypertension', 'htn', 'patients', 'related', 'consequences', 'must', 'first', 'identify', 'underlying', 'cause', 'disease', 'patient', 'interventions', 'regularly', 'implemented', 'clinicians', 'likelihood', 'complications', 'htn', 'increases', 'gap', 'staff', 'knowledge', 'managing', 'patients', 'htn', 'identified', 'outpatient', 'clinic', 'midwestern', 'united', 'states', 'staff', 'education', 'program', 'health', 'care', 'providers', 'close', 'knowledge', 'gap', 'developed', 'based', 'recent', 'veterans', 'clinical', 'practice', 'guidelines', 'management', 'htn', 'aim', 'project', 'explore', 'impact', 'staff', 'education', 'program', 'increasing', 'clinical', 'personnel', 'awareness', 'management', 'htn', 'health', 'promotion', 'model', 'played', 'critical', 'role', 'guiding', 'project', 'development', 'implementation', 'three', 'expert', 'stakeholders', 'endorsed', 'project', 'agreeing', 'educational', 'program', 'content', 'applied', 'clinical', 'practice', 'would', 'increase', 'staff', 'understanding', 'management', 'diagnosis', 'htn', 'ten', 'clinical', 'staff', 'members', 'participated', 'education', 'program', 'first', 'completing', 'pretest', 'questionnaire', 'viewing', 'powerpoint', 'presentation', 'outlining', 'educational', 'program', 'content', 'participants', 'completed', 'posttest', 'questionnaires', 'assess', 'knowledge', 'following', 'powerpoint', 'presentation', 'posttest', 'results', 'suggested', 'staff', 'knowledge', 'grew', 'due', 'learning', 'gain', 'program', 'original', 'baseline', 'project', 'potential', 'positive', 'social', 'change', 'evidence', 'staff', 'education', 'translated', 'practice', 'resulting', 'improved', 'patient', 'management', 'treatment', 'htn']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Continuous Learning
From the Editor-in-Chief,"[...]the military is dependent on industry to supply material, innovation and other support, while the defense industry depends on government for requirements, oversight and revenue. For a glimpse at how the Army is modernizing and collaborating, take a look at how Army Futures Command's Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team is using early input from Soldiers during system development to inform capability requirements and improve Army aviation modernization in ""Feedback Loop"" (Page 21). [...]this issue showcases several articles where the Army is using and manipulating data to achieve a better Army: * See how the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command is researching the intersection of humans, data and technology across the military health system in ""The Blueprint"" (Page 8). * Or how the Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications - Tactical is creating a digital ""fabric"" from a variety of information sources to support functions like logistics or aviation in ""Stitching the Army's Data Fabric"" (Page 14). * Finally, learn how the Army's Office of the Chief Information Officer is taking a holistic approach to data in developing a strategic direction toward a lethal, ready and digital Army of 2028 in ""The Digital Army of the Future"" (Page 30).",2595669316,,,Trade Journals,,"McCouch, Nelson, III",,, Copyright Superintendent of Documents Fall 2021,,, General Information,, Fall 2021," Chief , Revolution in military affairs , Military , Editing , Human-computer interaction",,1529-8507,, English, English,, 3, Fort Belvoir,Fall 2021,Army AL & T,2021,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/editor-chief/docview/2595669316/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amilitary&amp;atitle=From+the+Editor-in-Chief&amp;title=Army+AL+%26+T&amp;issn=15298507&amp;date=2021-10-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=3&amp;au=McCouch%2C+Nelson%2C+III&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Army+AL+%26+T&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",dependent industry supply material innovation support industry depends government requirement oversight revenue glimpse army modernizing collaborating take look army future command future vertical lift team using early input soldier system development inform capability requirement improve army aviation modernization feedback loop page issue showcase several article army using manipulating achieve better army see army medical development command researching intersection human technology across health system blueprint page program executive office command control communication tactical creating digital fabric variety information source support function like logistics aviation stitching army fabric page finally learn army office chief information officer taking holistic developing strategic direction toward lethal ready digital army digital army future page,"['dependent', 'industry', 'supply', 'material', 'innovation', 'support', 'industry', 'depends', 'government', 'requirements', 'oversight', 'revenue', 'glimpse', 'army', 'modernizing', 'collaborating', 'take', 'look', 'army', 'futures', 'command', 'future', 'vertical', 'lift', 'team', 'using', 'early', 'input', 'soldiers', 'system', 'development', 'inform', 'capability', 'requirements', 'improve', 'army', 'aviation', 'modernization', 'feedback', 'loop', 'page', 'issue', 'showcases', 'several', 'articles', 'army', 'using', 'manipulating', 'data', 'achieve', 'better', 'army', 'see', 'army', 'medical', 'development', 'command', 'researching', 'intersection', 'humans', 'data', 'technology', 'across', 'health', 'system', 'blueprint', 'page', 'program', 'executive', 'office', 'command', 'control', 'communications', 'tactical', 'creating', 'digital', 'fabric', 'variety', 'information', 'sources', 'support', 'functions', 'like', 'logistics', 'aviation', 'stitching', 'army', 'data', 'fabric', 'page', 'finally', 'learn', 'army', 'office', 'chief', 'information', 'officer', 'taking', 'holistic', 'data', 'developing', 'strategic', 'direction', 'toward', 'lethal', 'ready', 'digital', 'army', 'digital', 'army', 'future', 'page']",General Information,0,Management and Leadership
STITCHING THE ARMY'S DATA FABRIC,"[...]artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities-a necessity in order to operate at the speed of digital war-are starved for data, because warfighting systems generate information at high volume but without great value, as much of the collected data remains unprocessed and difficult to find, unbeknownst to the operator. Recently, the JADC2 Cross-Functional Team, run by the Joint Staff J-6, codified data fabric as a ""Department of Defense federated data environment for sharing information through interfaces and services to discover, understand, and exchange data with partners across all domains, security levels and echelons."" In late 2019, the Army issued a request for information to industry on data fabric as part of the recurring technical exchange meeting process, which is led by the Army Futures Command Network Cross-Functional Team (CFT) and the Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications - Tactical (PEO C3T) to shape and target commercial innovation for potential Capability Set fielding. (The 6 A category is the DOD research, development, test and evaluation budget activity code for advanced component development and prototypes.)

Using Risk as the Lens to Envision High-Reliability Principles in Healthcare,"Early work began in the Federal Aviation Administration’s Air Traffic Control System Command Center, at commercial nuclear power plants, and aboard U.S. Navy aircraft carriers. In 1989, the constructs of Carolyn Libuser’s maximizing reliability model (process auditing, reward systems, avoiding quality degradation, risk perception, and command and control) were used to revitalize the pediatric intensive care unit at Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital (Roberts, 2003). Rounding provides an opportunity for role modeling and the chance to help individual team members understand the crucial roles they play in identifying risk. By using the risk mitigation lens and developing effective leadership strategies, offering a robust training program, and holding people accountable, healthcare organizations can create an environment where team members embrace their roles in striving for operational excellence and zero harm.",2582970245,,,Scholarly Journals," executive adviser, and , principal, Booz Allen Hamilton, Falls Church, Virginia","Bradshaw, Donald M;Keyser, Stephanie",,, © 2021 Foundation of the American College of Healthcare Executives,10.1097/JHM-D-21-00150,, Journal Article,, Jul-Aug 2021,,,1096-9012,4.0, English, English,, 250-253, Chicago,Jul-Aug 2021,Journal of Healthcare Management,2021,,66.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/using-risk-as-lens-envision-high-reliability/docview/2582970245/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Using+Risk+as+the+Lens+to+Envision+High-Reliability+Principles+in+Healthcare&amp;title=Journal+of+Healthcare+Management&amp;issn=10969012&amp;date=2021-07-01&amp;volume=66&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=250&amp;au=Bradshaw%2C+Donald+M%3BKeyser%2C+Stephanie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Healthcare+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1097%2FJHM-D-21-00150,"Health Research Premium Collection, ProQuest One Academic",early work began federal aviation administration air traffic control system command center commercial nuclear power plant aboard navy aircraft carrier construct carolyn libuser maximizing reliability model process auditing reward system avoiding quality degradation risk perception command control used revitalize pediatric intensive care unit loma linda child hospital robert rounding provides opportunity role modeling chance help individual team member understand crucial role play identifying risk using risk mitigation lens developing effective leadership strategy offering robust training program holding people accountable healthcare organization create environment team member embrace role striving operational excellence zero harm,"['early', 'work', 'began', 'federal', 'aviation', 'administration', 'air', 'traffic', 'control', 'system', 'command', 'center', 'commercial', 'nuclear', 'power', 'plants', 'aboard', 'navy', 'aircraft', 'carriers', 'constructs', 'carolyn', 'libuser', 'maximizing', 'reliability', 'model', 'process', 'auditing', 'reward', 'systems', 'avoiding', 'quality', 'degradation', 'risk', 'perception', 'command', 'control', 'used', 'revitalize', 'pediatric', 'intensive', 'care', 'unit', 'loma', 'linda', 'university', 'children', 'hospital', 'roberts', 'rounding', 'provides', 'opportunity', 'role', 'modeling', 'chance', 'help', 'individual', 'team', 'members', 'understand', 'crucial', 'roles', 'play', 'identifying', 'risk', 'using', 'risk', 'mitigation', 'lens', 'developing', 'effective', 'leadership', 'strategies', 'offering', 'robust', 'training', 'program', 'holding', 'people', 'accountable', 'healthcare', 'organizations', 'create', 'environment', 'team', 'members', 'embrace', 'roles', 'striving', 'operational', 'excellence', 'zero', 'harm']",Journal Article,0,Management and Leadership
Sustaining Relevance: Repositioning Strategic Logistics Innovation in the Military,"Military logistics innovation lacks a cross-service strategic picture. It hardly enjoys the backing of a strong military academic research community, with the exception of historical logistics studies.

Improvement of Project Management Efficiency With a Business Intelligence Solution in an Automotive Supplier Company,"The present dissertation thesis was developed under the Integrated Master in Engineering and Industrial Management of the University of Minho. This work was developed in the company Bosch Car Multimedia S.A, in Braga, in the project management section of the development department. The main goal was to improve the project management processes and efficiency by designing and implementing a Business Intelligence solution to monitor the development projects. The methodology “Action-research” was used, and the researcher was inserted in the daily life of a specific project team with the goal to understand their way of work, analyze improvement opportunities and to propose improvement actions. At the same time, a literature review was made with the combination of project management topics with Lean Thinking that aim for the “continuous improvement” of project management and also literature related to metrics, key performance indicators (KPI’s) and Dashboards. After analyzing the team activities, some opportunities were found in several areas that the project manager and the team members faced daily. These improvement opportunities were generally related to the lack of visibility of the several topics, the redundancy of information, documents and templates that were not efficient, lack of awareness on the project metrics and KPI’s. The solution proposed to use PowerBI to create a Project Dashboard that could centralize the topics on one single place, aiming for increasing visibility and information sharing. After the implementation on the first project, it was possible to reduce the time spending on team meetings, reports preparation, report meetings and some documents were simplified to be faster to fill and read. With the implementation, it is possible to estimate the saving amount of 7580€ on time savings, on one single project. The feedback of the team was collected using a questionnaire; the general perception is frankly positive and the expansion to other projects highly recommended. This expansion to other projects and to integrate several projects in the same dashboard, creating a “Portfolio Management Dashboard” was also initiated, but not concluded. Thus, the expansion of the dashboard is a suggestion for future work, allowing to integrate other projects and other project management departments, aiming for the benefits obtained with the first trial project.",3164232446,, Melhoria da eficiência da gestão de projetos com uma solução de Business Intelligence numa empresa de componentes para veículos,Dissertations & Theses,,"Pereira, Isac Oliveira",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2021," Project management , Efficiency , Improvement", 9798302855107,,, English, English, Melhoria da eficiência da gestão de projetos com uma solução de Business Intelligence numa empresa de componentes para veículos,,,2021,PQDT -

Os Três Pilares da Sustentabilidade e Gestão ágil de Projectos: Como é Que Eles se Influenciam,"The industrial world is becoming more competitive with each passing day. Companies face new challenges and to survive, they need to find ways to stand out from the rest. One way for companies to do this is to improve the quality of the products, this can be achieved by improving production planning. The goal of this thesis is to investigate a novel perspective within the theoretical area of agile project management and sustainability. The goal of the study is to prove that there are links between Agile Project Management and Sustainability, as well as to learn how Agile Project Management affects organization’s social, environmental, and economical dynamics from the triple bottom line standpoint. The research examines how agile project management ideas are connected to concepts from the three pillars of the triple bottom line using many case studies. The analysis task consisted of analyzing these concepts and relationships qualitatively to create a network diagram that graphically reproduced the existing links. The findings reveal that implementing Agile Project Management has a variety of effects on an organization's social, economic, and environmental dynamics. When the bulk of these interactions were examined, it was discovered that there is a favorable effect on all of them. This work also aims to explore the concepts related to Agile Project Management. In doing so, the author explores the questions of what the need for Project Management is, where did Project Management begin, what are the different approaches that a project can take, why the need for Agile Project Management, which methodologies exist within the Agile Project Management and what tools can help Agile Project Management to achieve results faster.",2734702815,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Nogueira, Maria Carolina Conceição Cancela",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2021,, 9798357521644,,, English, English,,,,2021,PQDT - Global,2021,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/os-três-pilares-da-sustentabilidade-e-gestão-ágil/docview/2734702815/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Os+Tr%C3%AAs+Pilares+da+Sustentabilidade+e+Gest%C3%A3o+%C3%A1gil+de+Projectos%3A+Como+%C3%A9+Que+Eles+se+Influenciam&amp;issn=&amp;date=2021-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nogueira%2C+Maria+Carolina+Concei%C3%A7%C3%A3o+Cancela&amp;isbn=9798357521644&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,industrial world becoming competitive passing day company face new challenge survive need find way stand rest one way company improve quality product achieved improving production planning goal investigate novel perspective within theoretical area agile project management sustainability goal prove link agile project management sustainability well learn agile project management affect organization social environmental economical dynamic triple bottom line standpoint examines agile project management idea connected concept three pillar triple bottom line using many case study task consisted analyzing concept relationship qualitatively create network diagram graphically reproduced existing link finding reveal implementing agile project management variety effect organization social economic environmental dynamic bulk interaction examined discovered favorable effect work also aim explore concept related agile project management author explores question need project management project management begin different approach project take need agile project management methodology exist within agile project management tool help agile project management achieve result faster,"['industrial', 'world', 'becoming', 'competitive', 'passing', 'day', 'companies', 'face', 'new', 'challenges', 'survive', 'need', 'find', 'ways', 'stand', 'rest', 'one', 'way', 'companies', 'improve', 'quality', 'products', 'achieved', 'improving', 'production', 'planning', 'goal', 'thesis', 'investigate', 'novel', 'perspective', 'within', 'theoretical', 'area', 'agile', 'project', 'management', 'sustainability', 'goal', 'prove', 'links', 'agile', 'project', 'management', 'sustainability', 'well', 'learn', 'agile', 'project', 'management', 'affects', 'organization', 'social', 'environmental', 'economical', 'dynamics', 'triple', 'bottom', 'line', 'standpoint', 'examines', 'agile', 'project', 'management', 'ideas', 'connected', 'concepts', 'three', 'pillars', 'triple', 'bottom', 'line', 'using', 'many', 'case', 'studies', 'task', 'consisted', 'analyzing', 'concepts', 'relationships', 'qualitatively', 'create', 'network', 'diagram', 'graphically', 'reproduced', 'existing', 'links', 'findings', 'reveal', 'implementing', 'agile', 'project', 'management', 'variety', 'effects', 'organization', 'social', 'economic', 'environmental', 'dynamics', 'bulk', 'interactions', 'examined', 'discovered', 'favorable', 'effect', 'work', 'also', 'aims', 'explore', 'concepts', 'related', 'agile', 'project', 'management', 'author', 'explores', 'questions', 'need', 'project', 'management', 'project', 'management', 'begin', 'different', 'approaches', 'project', 'take', 'need', 'agile', 'project', 'management', 'methodologies', 'exist', 'within', 'agile', 'project', 'management', 'tools', 'help', 'agile', 'project', 'management', 'achieve', 'results', 'faster']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
Productivity Improvement in a Company of the Industry of Bolting Systems,"Nowadays, the companies face an extreme need of having high levels of productivity (P) in order to survive in the market`s competition. In this context, this work was performed in the production department of alki Technik GmbH, a company that operates in the field of bolting systems, making production of tools in a make-to-order (MTO) basis, and services as well. The work had the main aims of measurement of the production performance in terms of its P level and establishment of strategies to reach its improvement. The first phase of the work was focused in obtaining the necessary elements to measure the real levels of P in a weekly basis, which are the inputs (IN) in terms of time capacity and the outputs (OUT) in terms of time with production of tools and execution of services. After found ways to properly quantify IN and OUT, the P started to be observed and after the first three weeks, the observed Ps were considered too low for what the company needs, and it was also confirmed when compared with P levels presented in another studies. Some improvement methods were implemented, such as, a Visual Management (VM) method, which consisted in establishing each Friday a map with a work plan for the following week and placing it in the workshop, and Kaizen philosophy in terms of asking the employees about activities of their daily work that they considered that could be optimized to proceed with its analysis as Kaizen Optimizations (KOs), in order to find optimization solutions. A total of six KOs were proposed, being the time saving estimate of 101 hours per year. One of the KOs was immediate implemented, as well as the VM method, and the following three weeks showed P improvement, with the observed indexes of 59,2%, 52,1% and 58,3% respectively, when on previous weeks the highest observed value had been 43,7%. Finally, it was made the analysis of the workshop`s layout, as facility layouts play also a huge role in the productive performance, through the Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) method in order optimize the flows. From this analysis, two optimization alternatives (OAs) were designed. OA1, where a few changes are proposed without extra costs have been estimated a cost reduction with flows of 5,94% OA2, where some further changes are proposed, being in this case the estimated costs reduction with flows of 20,3%. However, this last OA would carry costs of its implementation. The conclusions highlight the P improvement achieved through this work. Further improvement was left through the KOsfor the process and OAsfor the workshop layout.",2734702781,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Oliveira, Jorge Miguel Porfírio",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2021,, 9798352999028,,, English, English,,,,2021,PQDT - Global,2021,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/productivity-improvement-company-industry-bolting/docview/2734702781/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Productivity+Improvement+in+a+Company+of+the+Industry+of+Bolting+Systems&amp;issn=&amp;date=2021-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Oliveira%2C+Jorge+Miguel+Porf%C3%ADrio&amp;isbn=9798352999028&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,nowadays company face extreme need high level productivity order survive market competition context work performed production alki technik gmbh company operates field bolting system making production tool mto basis service well work main aim measurement production performance term level establishment strategy reach improvement first phase work focused obtaining necessary element measure real level weekly basis input term time capacity output term time production tool execution service found way properly quantify started observed first three week observed considered low company need also confirmed compared level presented another study improvement method implemented visual management consisted establishing friday map work plan following week placing workshop kaizen philosophy term asking employee activity daily work considered could optimized proceed kaizen optimization ko order find optimization solution total six ko proposed time saving estimate hour per year one ko immediate implemented well following three week showed improvement observed index respectively previous week highest observed value finally made workshop layout facility layout play also huge role productive performance systematic layout planning slp order optimize flow two optimization alternative oas designed change proposed without extra cost estimated cost reduction flow change proposed case estimated cost reduction flow however last would carry cost implementation conclusion highlight improvement achieved work improvement left kosfor process oasfor workshop layout,"['nowadays', 'companies', 'face', 'extreme', 'need', 'high', 'levels', 'productivity', 'order', 'survive', 'market', 'competition', 'context', 'work', 'performed', 'production', 'alki', 'technik', 'gmbh', 'company', 'operates', 'field', 'bolting', 'systems', 'making', 'production', 'tools', 'mto', 'basis', 'services', 'well', 'work', 'main', 'aims', 'measurement', 'production', 'performance', 'terms', 'level', 'establishment', 'strategies', 'reach', 'improvement', 'first', 'phase', 'work', 'focused', 'obtaining', 'necessary', 'elements', 'measure', 'real', 'levels', 'weekly', 'basis', 'inputs', 'terms', 'time', 'capacity', 'outputs', 'terms', 'time', 'production', 'tools', 'execution', 'services', 'found', 'ways', 'properly', 'quantify', 'started', 'observed', 'first', 'three', 'weeks', 'observed', 'considered', 'low', 'company', 'needs', 'also', 'confirmed', 'compared', 'levels', 'presented', 'another', 'studies', 'improvement', 'methods', 'implemented', 'visual', 'management', 'consisted', 'establishing', 'friday', 'map', 'work', 'plan', 'following', 'week', 'placing', 'workshop', 'kaizen', 'philosophy', 'terms', 'asking', 'employees', 'activities', 'daily', 'work', 'considered', 'could', 'optimized', 'proceed', 'kaizen', 'optimizations', 'kos', 'order', 'find', 'optimization', 'solutions', 'total', 'six', 'kos', 'proposed', 'time', 'saving', 'estimate', 'hours', 'per', 'year', 'one', 'kos', 'immediate', 'implemented', 'well', 'following', 'three', 'weeks', 'showed', 'improvement', 'observed', 'indexes', 'respectively', 'previous', 'weeks', 'highest', 'observed', 'value', 'finally', 'made', 'workshop', 'layout', 'facility', 'layouts', 'play', 'also', 'huge', 'role', 'productive', 'performance', 'systematic', 'layout', 'planning', 'slp', 'order', 'optimize', 'flows', 'two', 'optimization', 'alternatives', 'oas', 'designed', 'changes', 'proposed', 'without', 'extra', 'costs', 'estimated', 'cost', 'reduction', 'flows', 'changes', 'proposed', 'case', 'estimated', 'costs', 'reduction', 'flows', 'however', 'last', 'would', 'carry', 'costs', 'implementation', 'conclusions', 'highlight', 'improvement', 'achieved', 'work', 'improvement', 'left', 'kosfor', 'process', 'oasfor', 'workshop', 'layout']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
Machine Learning Models for Predictive Quality,"Nowadays, companies that manufacture products, regardless of the product, have shown an increased interest in resolving one of their problems: manufacturing products with nonconformities. A nonconformity occurs when there is at least one product parameter that does not meet the intended specifications predetermined by the client. It can be classified as minor, major, and critical with the increase in negative effects on the product. The causes for the occurrence of nonconformities can range from the characteristics of the material to the conditions of the machines. However, they can also be related to the poor execution of the production process or changes in the product’s characteristics. The main purpose of this dissertation is the development of machine learning models capable of predicting whether a batch of manufactured products in a production line will be fabricated with or without nonconformities, considering the possible causes addressed before. The development of successful models can help companies reduce the production of defective products, leading to a decrease in material and energy waste and a reduction in the environmental impact. A standard CRISP-DM methodology was followed. In an initial phase, the data was collected, preprocessed, and analyzed. Afterward, a phase of new features creation occurred and, henceforth, the dataset was prepared to be used in the training of the machine learning models by making use of several techniques and methods. Finally, parameter tuning was performed to improve the models’ performances, resulting in a balanced accuracy average of was 84%. However, the mean precision and recall was of 37% and 70%, respectively. When comparing the AUC metric, the Artificial Neural Network classifier scored 0,91, Logistic Regression scored 0,97 and Random Forest scored 0,99.",2689287889,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Ferreira, João Nuno Rodrigues",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2021,, 9798835566525,,, English, English,,,,2021,PQDT - Global,2021,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/machine-learning-models-predictive-quality/docview/2689287889/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Machine+Learning+Models+for+Predictive+Quality&amp;issn=&amp;date=2021-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ferreira%2C+Jo%C3%A3o+Nuno+Rodrigues&amp;isbn=9798835566525&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,nowadays company manufacture product regardless product shown increased interest resolving one problem manufacturing product nonconformity nonconformity occurs least one product parameter meet intended specification predetermined client classified minor major critical increase negative effect product cause occurrence nonconformity range characteristic material condition machine however also related poor execution production process change product characteristic main purpose development machine learning model capable predicting whether batch manufactured product production line fabricated without nonconformity considering possible cause addressed development successful model help company reduce production defective product leading decrease material energy waste reduction environmental impact standard followed initial phase collected preprocessed analyzed afterward phase new feature creation occurred henceforth dataset prepared used training machine learning model making use several technique method finally parameter tuning performed improve model performance resulting balanced accuracy average however mean precision recall respectively comparing auc metric artificial neural network classifier scored logistic regression scored random forest scored,"['nowadays', 'companies', 'manufacture', 'products', 'regardless', 'product', 'shown', 'increased', 'interest', 'resolving', 'one', 'problems', 'manufacturing', 'products', 'nonconformities', 'nonconformity', 'occurs', 'least', 'one', 'product', 'parameter', 'meet', 'intended', 'specifications', 'predetermined', 'client', 'classified', 'minor', 'major', 'critical', 'increase', 'negative', 'effects', 'product', 'causes', 'occurrence', 'nonconformities', 'range', 'characteristics', 'material', 'conditions', 'machines', 'however', 'also', 'related', 'poor', 'execution', 'production', 'process', 'changes', 'product', 'characteristics', 'main', 'purpose', 'dissertation', 'development', 'machine', 'learning', 'models', 'capable', 'predicting', 'whether', 'batch', 'manufactured', 'products', 'production', 'line', 'fabricated', 'without', 'nonconformities', 'considering', 'possible', 'causes', 'addressed', 'development', 'successful', 'models', 'help', 'companies', 'reduce', 'production', 'defective', 'products', 'leading', 'decrease', 'material', 'energy', 'waste', 'reduction', 'environmental', 'impact', 'standard', 'followed', 'initial', 'phase', 'data', 'collected', 'preprocessed', 'analyzed', 'afterward', 'phase', 'new', 'features', 'creation', 'occurred', 'henceforth', 'dataset', 'prepared', 'used', 'training', 'machine', 'learning', 'models', 'making', 'use', 'several', 'techniques', 'methods', 'finally', 'parameter', 'tuning', 'performed', 'improve', 'models', 'performances', 'resulting', 'balanced', 'accuracy', 'average', 'however', 'mean', 'precision', 'recall', 'respectively', 'comparing', 'auc', 'metric', 'artificial', 'neural', 'network', 'classifier', 'scored', 'logistic', 'regression', 'scored', 'random', 'forest', 'scored']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
Analytics for Model-Based Engineering Trade Studies in the Development of DoD Systems,"Modern computing resources provide scientists, engineers, and system design teams the ability to study phenomena, such as system behavior, in a virtual setting. Computational modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) enables engineers to avoid many of the challenges encountered in traditional design engineering, including the design, manufacture, and testing of expensive prototypes prior to having an optimized system design. However, the use of M&amp;S carries its own challenges, such as the computational time and resources required to execute effective studies, and uncertainties arising from simplifying assumptions inherent to computer models, which are intended to be an approximate representation of reality. In recent years, advances have been made in a number of areas related to the efficient and reliable use of M&amp;S for system evaluations, including advances in the design &amp; analysis of computer experiments, uncertainty quantification, probabilistic analysis, response optimization, and data synthesis techniques. This research begins by reviewing existing literature across disciplines and consolidating a generalized framework for systematically executing efficient Model-Based Engineering (MBE) studies. This review serves to position and motivate the subsequent research, which includes: (1) Establishing a novel space-filling design approach for efficient variable screening and dimension reduction in deterministic modeling &amp; simulation. (2) Establish a desirability-based multi-objective optimization approach to better address competing objectives in a data visualization-based system trade study context. (3) Finally, a visual model validation methodology is established to address discrepancy between virtual data from computational models and physical data generated from validation experiments, and transitioning this information into a system trade study context. Comparison of these novel approaches to existing methods is made through comprehensive validation studies for the three distinct facets of this research, which involves the extensive use of simulation and statistical analyses, in combination with a variety of test functions, as well as case studies which serve to illustrate the relevance and impact of this research to real-world DoD systems.",2622950805,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Ray, Douglas",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

High Reliability at a U.S. Air Force Outpatient Clinic: Have We Improved and Are We Ready for the Future,"Preventable medical errors may now be the third leading cause of death in the United States, following only heart disease and cancer as the Nation?s biggest killers (Makary &amp; Daniel, 2016). If that weren?t bad enough, it is estimated that the incidence of preventable medical errors that lead to serious patient harm may be 10 to 20 times higher than those that cause death (James, 2013). The vast majority of people across the globe will, at some point in their lives, require the services of a healthcare organization. During each of these encounters with an industry dedicated solely to improving health, they will be at significant risk for unintended harm and even death. In the United States, this healthcare issue was first presented to the public consciousness more than two decades ago when the Institute of Medicine published its report, To Err is Human Building a Safer Health System (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2000). Today, after more than 20 years of industry focus, vast numbers of studies, and quality improvement recommendations, preventable medical errors still occur every day across the U.S. and around the world. Many healthcare organizations are trying to improve patient safety by adopting the principles of high reliability, including a preoccupation with failure, resiliency, and organizational mindfulness. The setting for this research is at a U.S. Air Force Tier-1 outpatient clinic. The high-reliability program that the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) rolled out to all Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) is called Trusted Care. This study sought to examine and reveal relational evidence between the principles of high reliability, preventable medical errors and perceived organizational patient safety culture through retrospective data analysis. Utilizing safety reporting data and the results of organizational culture surveys, the results of this study indicated that there is evidence linking the Trusted Care high reliability program to improvements in patient safety within the outpatient setting at the study organization.",2596642340,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Grodrian, Stanley Wayne",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2021," Air Force Medical Service , Trusted care , Medical error , Organizational patient safety culture", 9798460403400,,, English, English,,,,2021,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2021,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/high-reliability-at-u-s-air-force-outpatient/docview/2596642340/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=High+Reliability+at+a+U.S.+Air+Force+Outpatient+Clinic%3A+Have+We+Improved+and+Are+We+Ready+for+the+Future&amp;issn=&amp;date=2021-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grodrian%2C+Stanley+Wayne&amp;isbn=9798460403400&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Health Research Premium Collection, Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",preventable medical error may third leading cause death united state following heart disease cancer nation biggest killer makary amp daniel bad enough estimated incidence preventable medical error lead serious patient harm may time higher cause death james vast majority people across globe point life require service healthcare organization encounter industry dedicated solely improving health significant risk unintended harm even death united state healthcare issue first presented public consciousness two decade ago institute medicine published report err human building safer health system institute medicine iom today year industry focus vast number study quality improvement recommendation preventable medical error still occur every day across around world many healthcare organization trying improve patient safety adopting principle high reliability including preoccupation failure resiliency organizational mindfulness setting air force outpatient clinic program air force medical service afms rolled medical treatment facility mtf called trusted care sought examine reveal relational evidence principle high reliability preventable medical error perceived organizational patient safety culture retrospective utilizing safety reporting result organizational culture survey result indicated evidence linking trusted care high reliability program improvement patient safety within outpatient setting organization,"['preventable', 'medical', 'errors', 'may', 'third', 'leading', 'cause', 'death', 'united', 'states', 'following', 'heart', 'disease', 'cancer', 'nation', 'biggest', 'killers', 'makary', 'amp', 'daniel', 'bad', 'enough', 'estimated', 'incidence', 'preventable', 'medical', 'errors', 'lead', 'serious', 'patient', 'harm', 'may', 'times', 'higher', 'cause', 'death', 'james', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'across', 'globe', 'point', 'lives', 'require', 'services', 'healthcare', 'organization', 'encounters', 'industry', 'dedicated', 'solely', 'improving', 'health', 'significant', 'risk', 'unintended', 'harm', 'even', 'death', 'united', 'states', 'healthcare', 'issue', 'first', 'presented', 'public', 'consciousness', 'two', 'decades', 'ago', 'institute', 'medicine', 'published', 'report', 'err', 'human', 'building', 'safer', 'health', 'system', 'institute', 'medicine', 'iom', 'today', 'years', 'industry', 'focus', 'vast', 'numbers', 'studies', 'quality', 'improvement', 'recommendations', 'preventable', 'medical', 'errors', 'still', 'occur', 'every', 'day', 'across', 'around', 'world', 'many', 'healthcare', 'organizations', 'trying', 'improve', 'patient', 'safety', 'adopting', 'principles', 'high', 'reliability', 'including', 'preoccupation', 'failure', 'resiliency', 'organizational', 'mindfulness', 'setting', 'air', 'force', 'outpatient', 'clinic', 'program', 'air', 'force', 'medical', 'service', 'afms', 'rolled', 'medical', 'treatment', 'facilities', 'mtf', 'called', 'trusted', 'care', 'sought', 'examine', 'reveal', 'relational', 'evidence', 'principles', 'high', 'reliability', 'preventable', 'medical', 'errors', 'perceived', 'organizational', 'patient', 'safety', 'culture', 'retrospective', 'data', 'utilizing', 'safety', 'reporting', 'data', 'results', 'organizational', 'culture', 'surveys', 'results', 'indicated', 'evidence', 'linking', 'trusted', 'care', 'high', 'reliability', 'program', 'improvements', 'patient', 'safety', 'within', 'outpatient', 'setting', 'organization']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Breaking the Black Brass Ceiling: An Examination of Success Strategies of Veteran and Retired African American Female Leaders during Their Career Ascension to Top Leadership Positions in the United States Department of Defense,"This qualitative research addressed limitations and identified success strategies for African American women during their career ascension in the United States Department of Defense. The researcher used a phenomenological approach to understand African American servicewomen's lived experiences in attaining top leadership positions. Intersectionality, tokenism, and gender inequalities played vital roles in this study, contributing to the challenges African American females faced in the armed forces (Moore, 1991). Intersectionality explains the multi-layered experiences black women encounter with gender and race (Crenshaw, 2017). In highlighting gender inequities and limitations, this paper discoursed a historical overview of African Americans in the military, women's first entrance into the military, and social and cultural perspectives experienced. Systemic prejudices have prevented opportunities for African American servicewomen. Reis and Menezes (2020) purported challenges with addressing gender equality in the military. The perception that women were not physically, mentally, and psychologically capable of serving in non-traditional roles were examples assessed to describe women's civil rights. Using purposive sampling, the researcher interviewed 15 veterans and retired African American servicewomen who occupied leadership positions. This research study discovered vital components that will help future leaders overcome challenges and barriers to top leadership positions. This study's findings and the accompanying literature will impart several specific suggestions for African American servicewomen pursuing advancement to top leadership positions.",2572190126,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Blanche, Tawanna",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2021," Gender inequalities and limitations , Military standards for women , Retired , Servicewomen , Top leadership positions , Veteran", 9798535543017,,, English, English,,,,2021,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2021,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/breaking-black-brass-ceiling-examination-success/docview/2572190126/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Breaking+the+Black+Brass+Ceiling%3A+An+Examination+of+Success+Strategies+of+Veteran+and+Retired+African+American+Female+Leaders+during+Their+Career+Ascension+to+Top+Leadership+Positions+in+the+United+States+Department+of+Defense&amp;issn=&amp;date=2021-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Blanche%2C+Tawanna&amp;isbn=9798535543017&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,qualitative addressed limitation identified success strategy african american woman career ascension united state researcher used phenomenological understand african american servicewomen lived experience attaining top leadership position intersectionality tokenism gender inequality played vital role contributing challenge african american female faced armed force moore intersectionality explains experience black woman encounter gender race crenshaw highlighting gender inequity limitation discoursed historical overview african american woman first entrance social cultural perspective experienced systemic prejudice prevented opportunity african american servicewomen real menezes purported challenge addressing gender equality perception woman physically mentally psychologically capable serving role example assessed describe woman civil right using purposive sampling researcher interviewed veteran retired african american servicewomen occupied leadership position discovered vital component help future leader overcome challenge barrier top leadership position finding accompanying literature impart several specific suggestion african american servicewomen pursuing advancement top leadership position,"['qualitative', 'addressed', 'limitations', 'identified', 'success', 'strategies', 'african', 'american', 'women', 'career', 'ascension', 'united', 'states', 'researcher', 'used', 'phenomenological', 'understand', 'african', 'american', 'servicewomen', 'lived', 'experiences', 'attaining', 'top', 'leadership', 'positions', 'intersectionality', 'tokenism', 'gender', 'inequalities', 'played', 'vital', 'roles', 'contributing', 'challenges', 'african', 'american', 'females', 'faced', 'armed', 'forces', 'moore', 'intersectionality', 'explains', 'experiences', 'black', 'women', 'encounter', 'gender', 'race', 'crenshaw', 'highlighting', 'gender', 'inequities', 'limitations', 'discoursed', 'historical', 'overview', 'african', 'americans', 'women', 'first', 'entrance', 'social', 'cultural', 'perspectives', 'experienced', 'systemic', 'prejudices', 'prevented', 'opportunities', 'african', 'american', 'servicewomen', 'reis', 'menezes', 'purported', 'challenges', 'addressing', 'gender', 'equality', 'perception', 'women', 'physically', 'mentally', 'psychologically', 'capable', 'serving', 'roles', 'examples', 'assessed', 'describe', 'women', 'civil', 'rights', 'using', 'purposive', 'sampling', 'researcher', 'interviewed', 'veterans', 'retired', 'african', 'american', 'servicewomen', 'occupied', 'leadership', 'positions', 'discovered', 'vital', 'components', 'help', 'future', 'leaders', 'overcome', 'challenges', 'barriers', 'top', 'leadership', 'positions', 'findings', 'accompanying', 'literature', 'impart', 'several', 'specific', 'suggestions', 'african', 'american', 'servicewomen', 'pursuing', 'advancement', 'top', 'leadership', 'positions']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
A Qualitative Study on Government Project Overruns: From the Users Perspective,"The purpose of this research is to offer solutions to reducing systemic overruns of government projects within a U.S. Air Force Squadron. The researcher provided recommendations for improvements in project completions times and budget overruns. The projects (modifications) that take place within the chosen U.S. Air Force Unit are to add new capabilities to production and preproduction aircraft that enhance the ability of the Air Force to maximize the capability of that aircraft. The problem that the DSP solved through a combination of extensive research into previously published literature is a lack of knowledge into why there is a continual overrun of the projects completed by the U.S. Air Force Squadron. Since the scope of the U.S. Air Force is so large, the projects chosen were from a single squadron that develops, designs, installs and maintains the test equipment necessary to ensure all test measures are completed and data gathered. The qualitative research method that was used in this study was made up of a follow-up focus group, in-depth interviews and document analysis. The participants that took part in this study are all employees of the U.S. Air Force and assigned to the chosen squadron. Unlike other Military Units, the participants in this research study are Air Force Civilians who report to an Air Force Civilian Director. The breakdown of participants was a make-up consisting of Squadron managers, engineers and technicians. The data analysis for this research was conducted using the software program DeDoose. Eighteen interview transcripts and the follow-up focus group transcript were coded together to facilitate data triangulation. It was revealed that a majority of those interviewed perceived human error as the largest cause of systematic project overruns in time and monies; these were largely related to delay and waste stemming from poor coordination of human resources. A majority of the respondents also noted that there was an external pressure to proceed with inadequate information and project parameters, suggesting that poor leadership also related heavily to the problems associated with successful USAF squadron project completion. Overall, the results of this research filled the gap in understanding how key stakeholders perceive the reasons for systematic project overruns in the USAF squadron. The implications of this data is significant, as it pertains to the leadership, communication, and strategic planning, coordination, and protocols currently utilized by the squadron. The first of these relates to the inherent need for greater management of human resources within the squadron. As these results correlated so significantly with previous research, it should be argued that the USAF squadron must address their human resource management as a matter of national defense. This also pertains to the requirement for greater communication and project parameters prior to commencement of any new project.",2570368405,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Nolet, Maurice Daniel",,,

Conducting a Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA) during Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) en Route Care Operations – Developing a Model for LOSA within a Patient Care Setting,"In a comprehensive review of regulated en route patient care, Bridges (2018) identified the need for research to evaluate and describe the state of current Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) crew en route care practices related to patient safety including patient handoffs or handovers, material and equipment events, and crew safety performance. Actual work performance rarely occurs as expected – work-as-imagined versus work-as-done (Hollnagel et al., 2015). Those closest to the work are sometimes referred to as the ‘sharp-end’ (nurses, pilots, technicians, mechanics, doctors, etc.). These sharp-end practitioners are required to make constant workflow adaptations and trade-offs throughout the work period to maximize effectiveness, efficiency, and safety. The ‘blunt-end’ (policymakers, managers, supply-chain personnel, etc.) refers to operations management staff who support the sharp-end mission usually at a distance in space and time (Hollnagel et al., 2015). Developing an accurate representation of work-as-done ensures blunt-end policies, procedures, and resources enhance sharp-end work performance by removing unnecessary constraints, improving work processes, and ensuring critical equipment and supplies are available when needed. Since 2006, the Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA) safety management methodology has been used by military and commercial aviation operators to create a ‘snapshot’ view of work-as-done versus work-as-imagined. LOSA has become part of a proactive safety management activity to calibrate the sharp-end while synchronizing the blunt-end. LOSA includes the collection of de-identified, non-punitive quantitative and qualitative work performance data by trained LOSA observers during live operational missions. Data collected during a LOSA is analyzed, categorized, and prioritized by threats (events adding operational complexity outside the control of the crew), errors (crew deviations from expectations or intentions) or undesired states (errors that degrade safety margins or near-misses) (FAA, 2006). The objective of the dissertation was to analyze, compare, and report AE system threats, AE crew errors, and undesired states using the LOSA methodology during 60 live U.S. Air Force AE en route patient care missions (AE-LOSA) from February-March 2020. The AE-LOSA data collected was analyzed and reported using the established LOSA reporting framework developed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA, 2006). Comparisons to other Air Force crew member (cockpit crews and loadmaster crews) Threat and Error Management (TEM) outcomes were included from previous Air Force LOSAs. Additionally, a logic model was developed to inform future LOSA implications and implementations in other patient care settings (Taylor-Powell &amp; Henert, 2008). The results of the mixed methods study served as a baseline measure of the AE TEM program, identified opportunities for improving AE crew safety and patient safety, and provided a new perspective of work-as-done to prioritize system enhancements in training, policies, technology, equipment, and other critical aircrew resources.",2528581212,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Powell, Stephen M.",,,

The Evolution of Organization Development in the U.S. Military: An Examination of Intervention Typologies,"The purpose of this study was to explore the rationale for the selection of diverse Organization Development (OD) intervention typologies within the U.S. military. The U.S. military, as the core constituent of the Department of Defense, collectively represents the largest and most complex organization on earth. As such, the U.S. military implemented the largest formal OD programs in the world. These programs, from inception to present day, utilized diverse and evolving OD intervention typologies to garner congruence with the environment. This research, using an inductive, grounded theory approach, examined the initiatives that fostered the use of OD intervention typologies. The findings revealed three major epochs of OD interventions that span a 50-year timeline. The epochs include: (1) Traditional OD; (2) Total Quality Management (TQM); and (3) Continuous Process Improvement (CPI). The epoch of Traditional OD represents the use of human process interventions while TQM and CPI represent the use of technostructural interventions. The analysis of findings was integrated to construct a theoretical model that depicts the answers to six core research questions. In the end, the relationship between the independent variables, organization design and culture, and the dependent variable, the selection of OD intervention typologies, were best explained using mediating and moderating variables. These variables explain diverse environmental occurrences that influenced senior military leaders’ perceived need for specific OD interventions. These perceived needs were predicated on the requirement to exploit vital resources in an effort to bolster warfighting operational readiness.",2518960073,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Reinhard, Robert L.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2021," Continuous process Improvement , Culture , Military , Organization design , Organization Development , Total Quality Management , Intervention , Operational readiness", 9798708748362,,, English, English,,,,2021,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2021,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/evolution-organization-development-u-s-military/docview/2518960073/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Evolution+of+Organization+Development+in+the+U.S.+Military%3A+An+Examination+of+Intervention+Typologies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2021-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reinhard%2C+Robert+L.&amp;isbn=9798708748362&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",purpose explore rationale selection diverse organization development intervention typology within core constituent collectively represents largest complex organization earth implemented largest formal program world program inception present day utilized diverse evolving intervention typology garner congruence environment using inductive grounded theory examined initiative fostered use intervention typology finding revealed three major epoch intervention span timeline epoch include traditional total quality management tqm continuous process improvement cpi epoch traditional represents use human process intervention tqm cpi represent use technostructural intervention finding integrated construct theoretical model depicts answer six core question end relationship independent variable organization design culture dependent variable selection intervention typology best explained using mediating moderating variable variable explain diverse environmental occurrence influenced senior leader perceived need specific intervention perceived need predicated requirement exploit vital resource effort bolster warfighting operational readiness,"['purpose', 'explore', 'rationale', 'selection', 'diverse', 'organization', 'development', 'intervention', 'typologies', 'within', 'core', 'constituent', 'collectively', 'represents', 'largest', 'complex', 'organization', 'earth', 'implemented', 'largest', 'formal', 'programs', 'world', 'programs', 'inception', 'present', 'day', 'utilized', 'diverse', 'evolving', 'intervention', 'typologies', 'garner', 'congruence', 'environment', 'using', 'inductive', 'grounded', 'theory', 'examined', 'initiatives', 'fostered', 'use', 'intervention', 'typologies', 'findings', 'revealed', 'three', 'major', 'epochs', 'interventions', 'span', 'timeline', 'epochs', 'include', 'traditional', 'total', 'quality', 'management', 'tqm', 'continuous', 'process', 'improvement', 'cpi', 'epoch', 'traditional', 'represents', 'use', 'human', 'process', 'interventions', 'tqm', 'cpi', 'represent', 'use', 'technostructural', 'interventions', 'findings', 'integrated', 'construct', 'theoretical', 'model', 'depicts', 'answers', 'six', 'core', 'questions', 'end', 'relationship', 'independent', 'variables', 'organization', 'design', 'culture', 'dependent', 'variable', 'selection', 'intervention', 'typologies', 'best', 'explained', 'using', 'mediating', 'moderating', 'variables', 'variables', 'explain', 'diverse', 'environmental', 'occurrences', 'influenced', 'senior', 'leaders', 'perceived', 'need', 'specific', 'interventions', 'perceived', 'needs', 'predicated', 'requirement', 'exploit', 'vital', 'resources', 'effort', 'bolster', 'warfighting', 'operational', 'readiness']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement
A Novel Shock Absorber with the Preload and Global Negative Stiffness for Effective Shock Isolation,"A novel shock absorber with the preload structure and global negative stiffness is proposed for the shock isolation of sensitive systems. The novel shock absorber is composed of a linear spring and permanent magnet sets. The preload force and negative stiffness region are related to the attractive force between permanent magnet sets. The aim of this paper is to investigate the shock isolation performance of the novel shock absorber. Firstly, a static analysis of the novel shock absorber is carried out. Secondly, the motion stability of the NSA is analyzed by the Jacobian Matrix and the shock response is calculated numerically compared with the conventional preload structures. Finally, the shock test of the novel shock absorber is completed to verify the above results. It is found that the novel shock absorber could be advantageous in improving shock isolation in terms of relative displacement and absolute acceleration compared with conventional preload structures.",2497890248,,,Scholarly Journals," School of Mechanical Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China , School of Mechanical Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China; Naval Research Academy, Beijing 100161, China , School of Mechanical Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China","Zeng, Zecui;Zhang, Lei;Yan, Ming",,," Copyright © 2021 Zecui Zeng et al.

Tobacco smoking induces metabolic reprogramming of renal cell carcinoma,"BACKGROUND. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common histologically defined renal cancer. However, it is not a uniform disease and includes several genetic subtypes with different prognoses. ccRCC is also characterized by distinctive metabolic reprogramming. Tobacco smoking (TS) is an established risk factor for ccRCC, with unknown effects on tumor pathobiology. METHODS. We investigated the landscape of ccRCCs and paired normal kidney tissues using integrated transcriptomic, metabolomic, and metallomic approaches in a cohort of white males who were long-term current smokers (LTS) or were never smokers (NS). RESULTS. All 3 Omics domains consistently identified a distinct metabolic subtype of ccRCCs in LTS, characterized by activation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) coupled with reprogramming of the malate-aspartate shuttle and metabolism of aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, and histidine. Cadmium, copper, and inorganic arsenic accumulated in LTS tumors, showing redistribution among intracellular pools, including relocation of copper into the cytochrome c oxidase complex. A gene expression signature based on the LTS metabolic subtype provided prognostic stratification of The Cancer Genome Atlas ccRCC tumors that was independent of genomic alterations. CONCLUSION. The work identified the TS-related metabolic subtype of ccRCC with vulnerabilities that can be exploited for precision medicine approaches targeting metabolic pathways. The results provided rationale for the development of metabolic biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic applications using evaluation of OXPHOS status. The metallomic analysis revealed the role of disrupted metal homeostasis in ccRCC, highlighting the importance of studying effects of metals from e-cigarettes and environmental exposures. FUNDING.

Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and Its Impact on the US Defense Acquisition Methods and Programs,"Almost 60% of the US Major Defense Acquisition Programs are either over budget or delayed in terms of schedule. To combat and address this, the Department of Defense has introduced and mandated the implementation of the Modular Open Systems Approach through the Better Buying Power 3.0 directive in 2015. This strategy will hope to combat technology obsolescence, upgrade current highly cohesive systems, and increase flexibility and innovation all the while trying to battle cost and schedule challenges. The US Defense industry is arguably undergoing its greatest transformation ever. Under strong pressure to decrease costs, accelerate the speed of product development, promote innovation, and enhance quality, the US Defense Department has been searching for new methods to transform its defense acquisition process. The US Department of Defense is the largest defense organization in the world, responsible for spending about $989 billion annually on technology acquisition. In fact, “the United States spends more on defense than the next nine countries combined” (Kimberly, 2019). Several years in, there is no evidence showcasing that this strategy is successful. This research alone gathers this evidence, albeit largely qualitative, and suggests how modular and open system supporters and contributors can make its effects more effective so that this promising approach can be further sustained. This research will benefit students and practitioners of systems engineering, stakeholders across government, industry, and academia that are affiliated with the production, quality, and manufacturing fields to promote a collaborative vision of better acquisition processes and program success.",2471375336,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Shah, Parth Devang",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2021," Defense acquisition , DoD , Modularity , MOSA , Open Systems , Systems engineering", 9798557003865,,, English, English,,,,2021,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2021,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/modular-open-systems-approach-mosa-impact-on-us/docview/2471375336/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Modular+Open+Systems+Approach+%28MOSA%29+and+Its+Impact+on+the+US+Defense+Acquisition+Methods+and+Programs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2021-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shah%2C+Parth+Devang&amp;isbn=9798557003865&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,almost major acquisition program either budget delayed term schedule combat address introduced mandated implementation modular open system better buying power directive strategy hope combat technology obsolescence upgrade current highly cohesive system increase flexibility innovation trying battle cost schedule challenge industry arguably undergoing greatest transformation ever strong pressure decrease cost accelerate speed product development promote innovation enhance quality searching new method transform acquisition process largest organization world responsible spending billion annually technology acquisition fact united state spends next nine country combined kimberly several year evidence showcasing strategy successful alone gather evidence albeit largely qualitative suggests modular open system supporter contributor make effect effective promising sustained benefit student practitioner system engineering stakeholder across government industry academia affiliated production quality manufacturing field promote collaborative vision better acquisition process program success,"['almost', 'major', 'acquisition', 'programs', 'either', 'budget', 'delayed', 'terms', 'schedule', 'combat', 'address', 'introduced', 'mandated', 'implementation', 'modular', 'open', 'systems', 'better', 'buying', 'power', 'directive', 'strategy', 'hope', 'combat', 'technology', 'obsolescence', 'upgrade', 'current', 'highly', 'cohesive', 'systems', 'increase', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'trying', 'battle', 'cost', 'schedule', 'challenges', 'industry', 'arguably', 'undergoing', 'greatest', 'transformation', 'ever', 'strong', 'pressure', 'decrease', 'costs', 'accelerate', 'speed', 'product', 'development', 'promote', 'innovation', 'enhance', 'quality', 'searching', 'new', 'methods', 'transform', 'acquisition', 'process', 'largest', 'organization', 'world', 'responsible', 'spending', 'billion', 'annually', 'technology', 'acquisition', 'fact', 'united', 'states', 'spends', 'next', 'nine', 'countries', 'combined', 'kimberly', 'several', 'years', 'evidence', 'showcasing', 'strategy', 'successful', 'alone', 'gathers', 'evidence', 'albeit', 'largely', 'qualitative', 'suggests', 'modular', 'open', 'system', 'supporters', 'contributors', 'make', 'effects', 'effective', 'promising', 'sustained', 'benefit', 'students', 'practitioners', 'systems', 'engineering', 'stakeholders', 'across', 'government', 'industry', 'academia', 'affiliated', 'production', 'quality', 'manufacturing', 'fields', 'promote', 'collaborative', 'vision', 'better', 'acquisition', 'processes', 'program', 'success']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement
"How to perform spectrum-based LC-HR-MS screening for more than 1,000 NPS with HighResNPS consensus fragment ions","Introduction The ever-changing market of new psychoactive substances (NPS) poses challenges for laboratories worldwide. Analytical toxicologists are constantly working to keep high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) screening libraries updated for NPS. This study sought to use the online crowd-sourced HighResNPS database for spectrum comparison screening, thereby broadening its utility to all HR-MS instruments. Method HighResNPS allows formation of a set of consensus fragment ions for a NPS and prioritises among multiple entries of collision-induced fragment ions. A subset of 42 NPS samples was analysed in data-independent acquisition (DIA) and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) modes on two different instruments. HighResNPS-computed spectra were generated with either Absolute (all fragment ions set to 100%) or Fractional (50% intensity reduction of former fragment ion) intensity. The acquired NPS data were analysed using the consensus library with computed ion intensities and evaluated with vendor-neutral screening software. Results Overall, of the 42 samples, 100% were identified, with 88% identified as the top candidate. Three samples had the correct candidate proposed as the second highest ranking NPS. In all three of those samples, the top proposed candidate was a positional isomer or closely related compound. Absolute intensity assignment provided identical scoring between the top two proposed compounds in two samples with DIA. DDA had a slightly higher identification rate in the spectra comparison screening with fractional intensity assignment, but no major differences were observed. Conclusion The fractional intensity assignment was slightly more advantageous than the absolute assignment. It was selective between proposed candidates, showed a high identification rate and had an overall higher fragmentation scoring. The candidates proposed by the HighResNPS library spectra comparison simplify the determination of NPS for researchers and toxicologists. The database provides free monthly updates of consensus spectra, thereby enabling laboratories to stay at the forefront of NPS screening by LC-HR-MS with spectra screening software.",2460089694,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Davidsen, Anders;Mardal, Marie;Linnet, Kristian;Petur Weihe Dalsgaard",, University of Copenhagen," © 2020 Davidsen et al.

THE DROIDS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,"Before we could align the supply chain for personal protective equipment or ventilators, we needed to know which hospital would require those supplies based on the spread of the virus. While a standards-based data exchange like the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM), which DOD nominally adopted in 2013, offers a framework for linking data elements across functional domains, it does not provide the structure necessary for a computer to move beyond representation of data and information to modeling knowledge or understanding. In the dystopian tradition, technology is often presented as a menace, as in the ""Terminator"" series, or HAL from ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but there are also more positive AI role models in popular culture, such as C-3PO from ""Star Wars"" or Tony Stark's ""Iron Man"" interface, Just A Rather Very Intelligent System (JARVIS).

UNDERSTANDING the CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT in the AFSB: Army Logistician,"Attributes of the most effective contract managers include mastery in tactical- and operational-level logistics; the desire to become experts in contracting; the analytical capacity to hold contractors accountable with quantifiable metrics; vigilance in quality assurance inspections; and a confident demeanor while engaged with corporate leaders. A very short list of the contracted services provided might include passback field level maintenance support to tactical formations, dining facilities, household goods shipments, dress uniform tailoring and seamstress services at Basic Combat Training centers, emergency vehicle maintenance services, and contracted school bus drivers. Two recent missions that highlight the importance of these contractors in building strategic readiness is the recent deployment of 82nd Airborne Division's Initial Response Force (IRF) and the divestiture of U.S. Army Special Operations Command's (USASOC) High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles for their fielding of the new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles. When a KTR's performance falls below the established AQL, the commander's options include: * Noncompliance reporting (NCR) * Invoice deductions * Negative or interim reporting on annual Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) assessments * Re-competing the contract before it expires to bring in a new KTR It is critical that deficiencies are documented in NCRs when meeting with the KTR to discuss their performance so the KO can issue a corrective action request (CAR) to be annotated in the KTR's CPARS assessment.",2400098524,,,Trade Journals,,"Carlstedt, Christopher",,," Copyright Superintendent of Documents, United States Army Apr-Jun 2020",,, Feature,, Apr-Jun 2020," Combination , Understanding",,2153-5973,2.0, English, English,, 84-88, Fort Lee,Apr-Jun 2020,Army Sustainment,2020,,52.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/understanding-contracting-environment-afsb/docview/2400098524/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amilitary&amp;atitle=UNDERSTANDING+the+CONTRACTING+ENVIRONMENT+in+the+AFSB%3A+Army+Logistician&amp;title=Army+Sustainment&amp;issn=21535973&amp;date=2020-04-01&amp;volume=52&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=84&amp;au=Carlstedt%2C+Christopher&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Army+Sustainment&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",attribute effective contract manager include mastery logistics desire become expert contracting analytical capacity hold contractor accountable quantifiable metric vigilance quality assurance inspection confident demeanor engaged corporate leader short list contracted service provided might include passback field level maintenance support tactical formation dining facility household good shipment dress uniform tailoring seamstress service basic combat training center emergency vehicle maintenance service contracted school bus driver two recent mission highlight importance contractor building strategic readiness recent deployment airborne division initial response force irf divestiture army special operation command usasoc high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle fielding new joint light tactical vehicle ktr performance fall established aql commander option include noncompliance reporting ncr invoice deduction negative interim reporting annual contractor performance assessment reporting system cpars assessment contract expires bring new ktr critical deficiency documented ncrs meeting ktr discus performance issue corrective action request car annotated ktr cpars assessment,"['attributes', 'effective', 'contract', 'managers', 'include', 'mastery', 'logistics', 'desire', 'become', 'experts', 'contracting', 'analytical', 'capacity', 'hold', 'contractors', 'accountable', 'quantifiable', 'metrics', 'vigilance', 'quality', 'assurance', 'inspections', 'confident', 'demeanor', 'engaged', 'corporate', 'leaders', 'short', 'list', 'contracted', 'services', 'provided', 'might', 'include', 'passback', 'field', 'level', 'maintenance', 'support', 'tactical', 'formations', 'dining', 'facilities', 'household', 'goods', 'shipments', 'dress', 'uniform', 'tailoring', 'seamstress', 'services', 'basic', 'combat', 'training', 'centers', 'emergency', 'vehicle', 'maintenance', 'services', 'contracted', 'school', 'bus', 'drivers', 'two', 'recent', 'missions', 'highlight', 'importance', 'contractors', 'building', 'strategic', 'readiness', 'recent', 'deployment', 'airborne', 'division', 'initial', 'response', 'force', 'irf', 'divestiture', 'army', 'special', 'operations', 'command', 'usasoc', 'high', 'mobility', 'multipurpose', 'wheeled', 'vehicles', 'fielding', 'new', 'joint', 'light', 'tactical', 'vehicles', 'ktr', 'performance', 'falls', 'established', 'aql', 'commander', 'options', 'include', 'noncompliance', 'reporting', 'ncr', 'invoice', 'deductions', 'negative', 'interim', 'reporting', 'annual', 'contractor', 'performance', 'assessment', 'reporting', 'system', 'cpars', 'assessments', 'contract', 'expires', 'bring', 'new', 'ktr', 'critical', 'deficiencies', 'documented', 'ncrs', 'meeting', 'ktr', 'discuss', 'performance', 'issue', 'corrective', 'action', 'request', 'car', 'annotated', 'ktr', 'cpars', 'assessment']",Feature,2,Management and Leadership
Exploring the Factors Responsible for the Delays in the Execution of Construction Projects by the National Department of Public Works and Infrastructure in South Africa,"The National Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (NDPWI) has the mandate from parliament to provide accommodation (buildings) and other infrastructure to some public service departments (clients). These clients include the South African Police Services (SAPS), Department of Defence (DOD), Department of Justice and Constitutional Development (DOJ &amp; CD), Department of Correctional Services (DCS) and Department of Home Affairs (DHA). However, it has been observed that considerable time is expended between project briefing and actual delivery of the infrastructure, resulting in time and cost overruns. Therefore, it has become necessary to evaluate the current project delivery process, with a view to identifying the causes of delay and proffer solutions on how to improve project delivery within the iron triangle of cost, time and quality, as well as to improve on customers’ satisfaction. A multiple site case study method of qualitative research was adopted. The Delphi technique, a method of consensus building, was used for data collection and analysis. The data are collected in iterative processes and distil the judgments of participants using a series of questionnaires interspersed with feedback. The participants, commonly referred to as experts or knowledgeable persons, are purposively selected within predetermined qualification criteria. The participants for this research were officers at the strategic and tactical levels of leadership, not lower than the rank of Engineer or Architect and must have spent at least five years in the respective office. Seventeen (17) participants who met the pre-qualification criteria where drawn from three zonal office of the NDPWI in Kimberley, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein as well as the Professional Services division in the Head office. The Focus group (FG) session was used to complement the results from the Delphi exercise. Eight (8) participants, among those who participated in the Delphi exercise, accepted the invitation to take part in the FG. First, they validated the findings from the Delphi exercise, x-ray the root causes to the problems identified and develops practical solutions The findings revealed that the major factors contributing to the delays include poor planning by the project execution team, ineffective monitoring of projects, centralization of the decisionmaking process, as well as lack of motivation of the in-house project management unit. Therefore, this research recommends that a compelling challenge be given to the project manager (PM) to be firm and properly coordinate the project execution team (PET) in order to deliver iv projects on schedule; enforce the penalty and reward clauses according to the conditions of the contract for all PET members; and adequately remunerate the in-house project management unit, to serve as a motivation for improved performance.",2595134438,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Cosa, Sandiso",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,

Risk Profile of Polish Enterprises in the Media Sector Listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange,"Risk management currently determines the probability of survival and development of enterpris­es. The main aim of this article is to attempt to map the risk profile of Polish companies in the me­dia sector listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) based on the categorization of risk fac­tors identified by them. Empirical research was carried out on a sample of 15 companies listed on this Stock Exchange. The goal of empirical research was achieved through triangulation of re­search methods and techniques. The main method used in the research procedure was content anal­ysis of source documents of the examined group of enterprises, mainly: annual reports (financial statements, management board reports), capital adequacy reports and other information published mandatory by WSE listed entities. The logical classification method and the comparative method in the closed comparison variant were also used. The main research findings indicate that the risk pro­file of the enterprises studied shows characteristics specific to the media sector that they represent.",2520827191,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Bąk, Sylwia",, Warsaw Stock Exchange," © 2020.

The expression signatures in liver and adipose tissue from obese Göttingen Minipigs reveal a predisposition for healthy fat accumulation,"Background Model animals are valuable resources for dissecting basic aspects of the regulation of obesity and metabolism. The translatability of results relies on understanding comparative aspects of molecular pathophysiology. Several studies have shown that despite the presence of overt obesity and dyslipidemia in the pig key human pathological hepatic findings such as hepatocellular ballooning and abundant steatosis are lacking in the model. Objectives The aim of this study was to elucidate why these histopathological characteristics did not occur in a high fat, fructose and cholesterol (FFC) diet-induced obese Göttingen Minipig model. Methods High-throughput expression profiling of more than 90 metabolically relevant genes was performed in liver, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of male minipigs diet fed: standard chow (SD, n  = 7); FFC diet ( n  = 14); FFC diet in streptozotocin-induced diabetic pigs (FFC DIA , n  = 8). Moreover, histopathological assessment of SAT and VAT was performed. Results 12, 4 and 1 genes were highly significantly differentially expressed in liver, SAT and VAT when comparing the FFC and SD groups whereas the corresponding numbers were 15, 2, and 1 when comparing the FFC DIA and SD groups. Although the minipigs in both FFC groups developed sever obesity and dyslipidemia, the insulin-signaling pathways were not affected. Notably, four genes involved in lipid acquisition and removal, were highly deregulated in the liver: PPARG, LPL, CD36 and FABP4 . These genes have been reported to play a major role in promoting hepatic steatosis in rodents and humans. Since very little macrophage-associated pro-inflammatory response was detected in the adipose tissues the expansion appears to have no adverse impact on adipose tissue metabolism.

IMPROVING THE FABRICATION PROCESS AT TOBYHANNA ARMY DEPOT,"Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) is a logistics center for the Department of Defense, specializing in electronic systems, and employs 3,388 people as a primary resourcing center for the military. The Tobyhanna Army Depots Equipage Branch is responsibility for maintenance and fabrication on contracted work orders. TYAD partnered with a team from the US Military Academy to apply the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) DMAIC process on fabrication backlog. LSS draws upon the literature of both six-sigma, focusing on defects and quality, as well as the lean literature, which focuses on eliminating waste to improve organizational processes. This paper describes the unique aspects of this project and the application of LSS tools and methods to improve the performance of the process. The delay in services to different work centers impacts TYAD's ability to complete contracted work within the agreed upon time frames. From June to August 2019, the average existing backlog per week within the Equipage Branch was 922 hours resulting in excess costs of overtime as well as increased lead times causing late deliveries across the depot. The branch is responsible for several jobs at different locations within TYAD from fabrication to equipment management. This creates unique challenges, compared to static assembly-line process, as workers perform operations at different areas of the facility then return to a starting point. This paper summarizes the team's application of LSS to analyze ways to make the process more efficient, improve the process, and ensure the process remains in control and stable over time.",2486553410,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Franco, Dominic, BS;Henry, Joseph, BS;Mulligan, Aidan, BS;Schiher, Benjamin, BS;Enos, James, PhD PEng;Pegues, Kathryn, PhD",," Kettering University , Department of Defense", Copyright American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM) 2020,,, Conference Proceedings,, 2020," Supply chain management , Lean Six Sigma , Six Sigma , DMAIC , Fabrication , Semiconductor device fabrication",,,, English, English,, 1-10, Huntsville,2020,Proceedings of the International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management.,2020,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/improving-fabrication-process-at-tobyhanna-army/docview/2486553410/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=IMPROVING+THE+FABRICATION+PROCESS+AT+TOBYHANNA+ARMY+DEPOT&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Franco%2C+Dominic%2C+BS%3BHenry%2C+Joseph%2C+BS%3BMulligan%2C+Aidan%2C+BS%3BSchiher%2C+Benjamin%2C+BS%3BEnos%2C+James%2C+PhD+PEng%3BPegues%2C+Kathryn%2C+PhD&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",tobyhanna army depot tyad logistics center specializing electronic system employ people primary resourcing center tobyhanna army depot equipage branch responsibility maintenance fabrication contracted work order tyad partnered team academy apply lean six sigma lss dmaic process fabrication backlog lss draw upon literature focusing defect quality well lean literature focus eliminating waste improve organizational process describes unique aspect project application lss tool method improve performance process delay service different work center impact tyad ability complete contracted work within agreed upon time frame june august average existing backlog per week within equipage branch hour resulting excess cost overtime well increased lead time causing late delivery across depot branch responsible several job different location within tyad fabrication equipment management creates unique challenge compared static process worker perform operation different area facility return starting point summarizes team application lss analyze way make process efficient improve process ensure process remains control stable time,"['tobyhanna', 'army', 'depot', 'tyad', 'logistics', 'center', 'specializing', 'electronic', 'systems', 'employs', 'people', 'primary', 'resourcing', 'center', 'tobyhanna', 'army', 'depots', 'equipage', 'branch', 'responsibility', 'maintenance', 'fabrication', 'contracted', 'work', 'orders', 'tyad', 'partnered', 'team', 'academy', 'apply', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'lss', 'dmaic', 'process', 'fabrication', 'backlog', 'lss', 'draws', 'upon', 'literature', 'focusing', 'defects', 'quality', 'well', 'lean', 'literature', 'focuses', 'eliminating', 'waste', 'improve', 'organizational', 'processes', 'describes', 'unique', 'aspects', 'project', 'application', 'lss', 'tools', 'methods', 'improve', 'performance', 'process', 'delay', 'services', 'different', 'work', 'centers', 'impacts', 'tyad', 'ability', 'complete', 'contracted', 'work', 'within', 'agreed', 'upon', 'time', 'frames', 'june', 'august', 'average', 'existing', 'backlog', 'per', 'week', 'within', 'equipage', 'branch', 'hours', 'resulting', 'excess', 'costs', 'overtime', 'well', 'increased', 'lead', 'times', 'causing', 'late', 'deliveries', 'across', 'depot', 'branch', 'responsible', 'several', 'jobs', 'different', 'locations', 'within', 'tyad', 'fabrication', 'equipment', 'management', 'creates', 'unique', 'challenges', 'compared', 'static', 'process', 'workers', 'perform', 'operations', 'different', 'areas', 'facility', 'return', 'starting', 'point', 'summarizes', 'team', 'application', 'lss', 'analyze', 'ways', 'make', 'process', 'efficient', 'improve', 'process', 'ensure', 'process', 'remains', 'control', 'stable', 'time']",Conference Proceedings,2,Process Improvement
IMPROVING FISCAL STEWARDSHIP WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR: DEVELOPMENT & IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXECUTION RATIO,"Active financial stewardship ensures that the Department of Defense maximizes its purchasing power. On average, the Army de-obligates between 3-5% of its annual Operating &amp; Maintenance budget which equates to billions of dollars of lost purchasing power (McConville &amp; McCarthy, 2018). Following the Lean Six Sigma methodology, this process improvement effort examined the factors that led to unliquidated obligations and used the findings to develop an improved process through which organizations can manage contracts during the period of availability for new obligations. This project documents the development and implementation of a new metric, the execution ratio, intended to help organizations quickly assess contract performance. The new process for contract management was piloted by the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan between February and June 2020. During the pilot period, the organization was able to de-obligate 5% of funds on existing contracts, preventing the loss of $19.2 million in purchasing power. The preliminary findings suggest that the inclusion of a key performance indicator for contract execution can result in an improvement in the final disbursement rate.",2486553332,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings, United States Army,"Smith, Brian A, MS;Pegues, J ADAM, MS;Pegues, Kathryn K, PhD",," Department of Defense , Government Accountability Office , Congress-US", Copyright American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM) 2020,,, Conference Proceedings,, 2020," Lean Six Sigma , Contract management , Public sector , Fiscal , Performance indicator",,,, English, English,, 1-10, Huntsville,2020,Proceedings of the International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management.,2020,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/improving-fiscal-stewardship-within-government/docview/2486553332/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=IMPROVING+FISCAL+STEWARDSHIP+WITHIN+THE+GOVERNMENT+SECTOR%3A+DEVELOPMENT+%26amp%3B+IMPLEMENTATION+OF+THE+EXECUTION+RATIO&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Smith%2C+Brian+A%2C+MS%3BPegues%2C+J+ADAM%2C+MS%3BPegues%2C+Kathryn+K%2C+PhD&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",active financial stewardship ensures maximizes purchasing power average army annual operating amp maintenance budget equates billion dollar lost purchasing power mcconville amp mccarthy following lean six sigma process improvement effort examined factor led unliquidated obligation used finding develop improved process organization manage contract period availability new obligation project document development implementation new metric execution ratio intended help organization quickly assess contract performance new process contract management piloted combined security transition february june pilot period organization able fund existing contract preventing loss million purchasing power preliminary finding suggest inclusion key performance indicator contract execution improvement final disbursement rate,"['active', 'financial', 'stewardship', 'ensures', 'maximizes', 'purchasing', 'power', 'average', 'army', 'annual', 'operating', 'amp', 'maintenance', 'budget', 'equates', 'billions', 'dollars', 'lost', 'purchasing', 'power', 'mcconville', 'amp', 'mccarthy', 'following', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'process', 'improvement', 'effort', 'examined', 'factors', 'led', 'unliquidated', 'obligations', 'used', 'findings', 'develop', 'improved', 'process', 'organizations', 'manage', 'contracts', 'period', 'availability', 'new', 'obligations', 'project', 'documents', 'development', 'implementation', 'new', 'metric', 'execution', 'ratio', 'intended', 'help', 'organizations', 'quickly', 'assess', 'contract', 'performance', 'new', 'process', 'contract', 'management', 'piloted', 'combined', 'security', 'transition', 'february', 'june', 'pilot', 'period', 'organization', 'able', 'funds', 'existing', 'contracts', 'preventing', 'loss', 'million', 'purchasing', 'power', 'preliminary', 'findings', 'suggest', 'inclusion', 'key', 'performance', 'indicator', 'contract', 'execution', 'result', 'improvement', 'final', 'disbursement', 'rate']",Conference Proceedings,2,Process Improvement
DEVELOPMENT OF AN EARLY LIFECYCLE CONCEPTUAL CONFIGURATION MANUFACTURABILITY ASSESSMENT METRIC FOR TRADESPACE ANALYTICS,"Systems Engineers conduct tradespace studies for the purpose of determining those preferred product design configurations that can provide enhanced value based on key selected parameters. The results of such analyses can identify those unique configuration sets that potentially provide more desirable value outcomes as defined for the product being evaluated. A significant limitation of most tradespace studies is the lack of consideration of manufacturing related criteria. Such studies may unintentionally infer that all unique design configurations are essentially equal in terms of their manufacturability while manufacturing related costs often vary significantly for different configurations over a products lifecycle. Department of Defense (DoD) sponsored research has resulted in the development of a methodology for calculating a manufacturability value based on subject matter expert (SME) evaluations of conceptual design criteria that can be available for inclusion in the tradespace early in a products lifecycle. This methodology includes the consideration of eight key, fundamental parameters of design, manufacturing operations, and supply chain as they collectively relate in terms of value inherent with a specified conceptual design configuration. The designs perceived manufacturability is calculated as a relative index value in terms of SME assessed risk using a typical risk matrix considering the likelihood and consequence of problematic situational occurrences. Once the SME performed assessments have been concluded, the compiled manufacturability database can subsequently be utilized for enhanced tradespace analytics by program decision makers. The methodology is explained via discussion of a simplified notional aircraft case study.",2486552525,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings, US Army Engineer Research and Development Center,"McCall, Tonya G;Dalton, Larry G, PE;Rinaudo, Christina H;Babin, Paul D, PhDPE;Watson, T Nathan, PE",,, Copyright American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM) 2020,,, Conference Proceedings,, 2020," Risk assessment , Design for manufacturability , Manufacturability",,,, English, English,, 1-11, Huntsville,2020,Proceedings of the International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management.,2020,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/development-early-lifecycle-conceptual/docview/2486552525/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=DEVELOPMENT+OF+AN+EARLY+LIFECYCLE+CONCEPTUAL+CONFIGURATION+MANUFACTURABILITY+ASSESSMENT+METRIC+FOR+TRADESPACE+ANALYTICS&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=McCall%2C+Tonya+G%3BDalton%2C+Larry+G%2C+PE%3BRinaudo%2C+Christina+H%3BBabin%2C+Paul+D%2C+PhDPE%3BWatson%2C+T+Nathan%2C+PE&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",system engineer conduct tradespace study purpose determining preferred product design configuration provide enhanced value based key selected parameter result analysis identify unique configuration set potentially provide desirable value outcome defined product evaluated significant limitation tradespace study lack consideration manufacturing related criterion study may unintentionally infer unique design configuration essentially equal term manufacturability manufacturing related cost often vary significantly different configuration product lifecycle sponsored resulted development calculating manufacturability value based subject matter expert sme evaluation conceptual design criterion available inclusion tradespace early product lifecycle includes consideration eight key fundamental parameter design manufacturing operation supply chain collectively relate term value inherent specified conceptual design configuration design perceived manufacturability calculated relative index value term sme assessed risk using typical risk matrix considering likelihood consequence problematic situational occurrence sme performed assessment concluded compiled manufacturability database subsequently utilized enhanced tradespace analytics program decision maker explained via discussion simplified notional aircraft case,"['systems', 'engineers', 'conduct', 'tradespace', 'studies', 'purpose', 'determining', 'preferred', 'product', 'design', 'configurations', 'provide', 'enhanced', 'value', 'based', 'key', 'selected', 'parameters', 'results', 'analyses', 'identify', 'unique', 'configuration', 'sets', 'potentially', 'provide', 'desirable', 'value', 'outcomes', 'defined', 'product', 'evaluated', 'significant', 'limitation', 'tradespace', 'studies', 'lack', 'consideration', 'manufacturing', 'related', 'criteria', 'studies', 'may', 'unintentionally', 'infer', 'unique', 'design', 'configurations', 'essentially', 'equal', 'terms', 'manufacturability', 'manufacturing', 'related', 'costs', 'often', 'vary', 'significantly', 'different', 'configurations', 'products', 'lifecycle', 'sponsored', 'resulted', 'development', 'calculating', 'manufacturability', 'value', 'based', 'subject', 'matter', 'expert', 'sme', 'evaluations', 'conceptual', 'design', 'criteria', 'available', 'inclusion', 'tradespace', 'early', 'products', 'lifecycle', 'includes', 'consideration', 'eight', 'key', 'fundamental', 'parameters', 'design', 'manufacturing', 'operations', 'supply', 'chain', 'collectively', 'relate', 'terms', 'value', 'inherent', 'specified', 'conceptual', 'design', 'configuration', 'designs', 'perceived', 'manufacturability', 'calculated', 'relative', 'index', 'value', 'terms', 'sme', 'assessed', 'risk', 'using', 'typical', 'risk', 'matrix', 'considering', 'likelihood', 'consequence', 'problematic', 'situational', 'occurrences', 'sme', 'performed', 'assessments', 'concluded', 'compiled', 'manufacturability', 'database', 'subsequently', 'utilized', 'enhanced', 'tradespace', 'analytics', 'program', 'decision', 'makers', 'explained', 'via', 'discussion', 'simplified', 'notional', 'aircraft', 'case']",Conference Proceedings,1,Continuous Learning
System Engineering for Radio Frequency Communication Consolidation with Parabolic Antenna Stacking,"This dissertation implements System Engineering (SE) practices while utilizing Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) methods through software applications for the design and development of a parabolic stacked antenna. Parabolic antenna stacking provides communication system consolidation by having multiple antennas on a single pedestal which reduces the number of U.S. Navy shipboard topside antennas. The dissertation begins with defining early phase system lifecycle processes and the correlation of these early processes to activities performed when the system is being developed. Performing SE practices with the assistance of MBSE, Agile, Lean methodologies and SE/engineering software applications reduces the likelihood of system failure, rework, schedule delays, and cost overruns. Using this approach, antenna system consolidation via parabolic antenna stacking is investigated while applying SE principles and utilizing SE software applications. SE/engineering software such as IBM Rational Software, Innoslate, Antenna Magus, ExtendSim, and CST Microwave Studio were used to perform SE activities denoted in ISO, IEC, and IEEE standards. A method to achieve multi-band capabilities on a single antenna pedestal in order to reduce the amount of U.S. Navy topside antennas is researched. An innovative approach of parabolic antenna stacking is presented to reduce the amount of antennas that take up physical space on shipboard platforms. Process simulation is presented to provide an approach to improve predicting delay times for operational availability measures and to identify process improvements through lean methodologies. Finally, this work concludes with a summary and suggestions for future work.",2481149806,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Sugama, Clive",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2020," Antenna measurements , Antenna radiation patterns , Communication systems , Model based system engineering , Satellite communication , Systems engineering", 9798557078931,,, English, English,,,,2020,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2020,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/system-engineering-radio-frequency-communication/docview/2481149806/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=System+Engineering+for+Radio+Frequency+Communication+Consolidation+with+Parabolic+Antenna+Stacking&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sugama%2C+Clive&amp;isbn=9798557078931&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,implement system engineering practice utilizing model based system engineering mbse method software application design development parabolic stacked antenna parabolic antenna stacking provides communication system consolidation multiple antenna single pedestal reduces number navy shipboard topside antenna begin defining early phase system lifecycle process correlation early process activity performed system developed performing practice assistance mbse agile lean methodology software application reduces likelihood system failure rework schedule delay cost overrun using antenna system consolidation via parabolic antenna stacking investigated applying principle utilizing software application software ibm rational software innoslate antenna magus extendsim cst microwave studio used perform activity denoted iso iec ieee standard achieve capability single antenna pedestal order reduce amount navy topside antenna researched innovative parabolic antenna stacking presented reduce amount antenna take physical space shipboard platform process simulation presented provide improve predicting delay time operational availability measure identify process improvement lean methodology finally work concludes summary suggestion future work,"['dissertation', 'implements', 'system', 'engineering', 'practices', 'utilizing', 'model', 'based', 'system', 'engineering', 'mbse', 'methods', 'software', 'applications', 'design', 'development', 'parabolic', 'stacked', 'antenna', 'parabolic', 'antenna', 'stacking', 'provides', 'communication', 'system', 'consolidation', 'multiple', 'antennas', 'single', 'pedestal', 'reduces', 'number', 'navy', 'shipboard', 'topside', 'antennas', 'dissertation', 'begins', 'defining', 'early', 'phase', 'system', 'lifecycle', 'processes', 'correlation', 'early', 'processes', 'activities', 'performed', 'system', 'developed', 'performing', 'practices', 'assistance', 'mbse', 'agile', 'lean', 'methodologies', 'software', 'applications', 'reduces', 'likelihood', 'system', 'failure', 'rework', 'schedule', 'delays', 'cost', 'overruns', 'using', 'antenna', 'system', 'consolidation', 'via', 'parabolic', 'antenna', 'stacking', 'investigated', 'applying', 'principles', 'utilizing', 'software', 'applications', 'software', 'ibm', 'rational', 'software', 'innoslate', 'antenna', 'magus', 'extendsim', 'cst', 'microwave', 'studio', 'used', 'perform', 'activities', 'denoted', 'iso', 'iec', 'ieee', 'standards', 'achieve', 'capabilities', 'single', 'antenna', 'pedestal', 'order', 'reduce', 'amount', 'navy', 'topside', 'antennas', 'researched', 'innovative', 'parabolic', 'antenna', 'stacking', 'presented', 'reduce', 'amount', 'antennas', 'take', 'physical', 'space', 'shipboard', 'platforms', 'process', 'simulation', 'presented', 'provide', 'improve', 'predicting', 'delay', 'times', 'operational', 'availability', 'measures', 'identify', 'process', 'improvements', 'lean', 'methodologies', 'finally', 'work', 'concludes', 'summary', 'suggestions', 'future', 'work']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
The Army’s Process to Evaluate Costs versus Benefits: A Case Study on the Change of Command Ceremonies,"This study applies the Clark and Estes (2008) gap analysis model as the methodological framework to determine how senior advisors of the U.S. Army evaluate the costs of ceremonies. This research focused on the change of command ceremonies at a specific division to gain an understanding of how these senior advisors determine the value of the change of command ceremonies, how the ceremonies impact combat readiness posturing, and if the organization prioritizes cost reduction efforts for the change of command ceremonies. Through literature review and interviews of 10 senior advisors, this research was able to identify the knowledge, motivation, and organizational influences associated with the change of command ceremonies. This study uncovered production loss costs associated with these ceremonies, and whether these influences were present at the organization and amongst the senior advisors. The findings discovered gaps in all three influence types. Senior advisors lacked both the critical skills regarding cost-benefit analysis and an understanding of production loss costs, and the organization did not provide the necessary support for senior advisors to evaluate the value of the change of command ceremonies. The study concludes with recommendations, consisting of a robust training-based solution and an implementation plan to close the gaps.",2476159147,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Malin, Ryan",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2020," Army , Ceremony , Command , Inactivity , Readiness , Tradition", 9798557030052,,, English, English,,,,2020,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2020,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/army-s-process-evaluate-costs-versus-benefits/docview/2476159147/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Army%E2%80%99s+Process+to+Evaluate+Costs+versus+Benefits%3A+A+Case+Study+on+the+Change+of+Command+Ceremonies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Malin%2C+Ryan&amp;isbn=9798557030052&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",applies clark estes gap model methodological framework determine senior advisor army evaluate cost ceremony focused change command ceremony specific division gain understanding senior advisor determine value change command ceremony ceremony impact combat readiness posturing organization prioritizes cost reduction effort change command ceremony literature review interview senior advisor able identify knowledge motivation organizational influence associated change command ceremony uncovered production loss cost associated ceremony whether influence present organization amongst senior advisor finding discovered gap three influence type senior advisor lacked critical skill regarding understanding production loss cost organization provide necessary support senior advisor evaluate value change command ceremony concludes recommendation consisting robust solution implementation plan close gap,"['applies', 'clark', 'estes', 'gap', 'model', 'methodological', 'framework', 'determine', 'senior', 'advisors', 'army', 'evaluate', 'costs', 'ceremonies', 'focused', 'change', 'command', 'ceremonies', 'specific', 'division', 'gain', 'understanding', 'senior', 'advisors', 'determine', 'value', 'change', 'command', 'ceremonies', 'ceremonies', 'impact', 'combat', 'readiness', 'posturing', 'organization', 'prioritizes', 'cost', 'reduction', 'efforts', 'change', 'command', 'ceremonies', 'literature', 'review', 'interviews', 'senior', 'advisors', 'able', 'identify', 'knowledge', 'motivation', 'organizational', 'influences', 'associated', 'change', 'command', 'ceremonies', 'uncovered', 'production', 'loss', 'costs', 'associated', 'ceremonies', 'whether', 'influences', 'present', 'organization', 'amongst', 'senior', 'advisors', 'findings', 'discovered', 'gaps', 'three', 'influence', 'types', 'senior', 'advisors', 'lacked', 'critical', 'skills', 'regarding', 'understanding', 'production', 'loss', 'costs', 'organization', 'provide', 'necessary', 'support', 'senior', 'advisors', 'evaluate', 'value', 'change', 'command', 'ceremonies', 'concludes', 'recommendations', 'consisting', 'robust', 'solution', 'implementation', 'plan', 'close', 'gaps']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Corrosion Prevention and Control Planning,"Foreword Corrosion costs the United States of America an estimated $451B annually.1 While guidance existed for corrosion prevention and control (CPC) planning, there wasn't a published standard that defined the key elements/composition of CPC planning for all public and private sector users as well as the suppliers of products (all equipment, systems, platforms, vehicles, support equipment and items necessary to perform a specific function or mission including all components of such items) and facilities (all buildings, structures, airfields, port facilities, surface and subterranean utility systems, heating and cooling systems, fuel tanks, pavements and bridges). The standard includes such items as: * Attributes that impact planning for CPC * Considerations for material selection and design to minimize corrosion * Items or topics that should be addressed in corrosion prevention and control planning which affect CPC in design, fabrication and construction, operation and use, and maintenance and sustainability * Characteristics of the key elements of CPC planning * Approaches to CPC assessment This standard was prepared in 2016 and revised in 2020 by Joint Task Group (JTG) 527, Corrosion Prevention and Control Planning Standard, a task group comprised of representatives from SSPC and NACE.

The Efficacy of the Civilian Education System Intermediate Course: An Exploratory Case Study,"The Department of Defense is the largest executive department in the federal government consisting of a workforce of approximately three-million military members and 654,000 civilians with more than 250,000 of those personnel assigned to the Department of Army Civilians (DAC)s. The Annual Civilian Education System (CES) Intermediate Course (IC) attendance numbers vary from all organizations; larger organizations may enroll up to 120 personnel while smaller organizations may enroll 15 personnel or below The research problem was that no research existed that measured the efficacy of the IC in developing effective civilian leaders or their performance after completion of the course. Not having a formal measure to look at the efficacy of the course is significant because in an era of strategic uncertainty and declining defense expenditures;, understanding and demonstrating leader development course efficacy remains important to the Army in optimizing leader development effectiveness. The purpose of this exploratory case study was to explore the efficacy of the CES IC for developing effective civilian leaders and their performance after completing the course. The graduates of the DACs and senior leaders were interviewed, who had various backgrounds and experiences with respect to military and non-military positions. The interviews were used to explore the efficacy of the CES IC. Through the conduct of interviews, the researcher determined what CES contributes to these graduates as they returned to their home station environment or organization. The study findings showed that CES does provide leadership development and relevant training to develop Army civilians to lead.",2439025684,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Charles, Nicholas P.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2020," Department of Defense , Civilian Education System , Civilian leaders , Army civilians , Leadership", 9798664770506,,, English, English,,,,2020,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2020,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/efficacy-civilian-education-system-intermediate/docview/2439025684/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Efficacy+of+the+Civilian+Education+System+Intermediate+Course%3A+An+Exploratory+Case+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Charles%2C+Nicholas+P.&amp;isbn=9798664770506&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",largest executive federal government consisting workforce approximately member civilian personnel assigned army civilian dac annual civilian education system ce intermediate course attendance number vary organization larger organization may enroll personnel smaller organization may enroll personnel problem existed measured efficacy developing effective civilian leader performance completion course formal measure look efficacy course significant era strategic uncertainty declining expenditure understanding demonstrating leader development course efficacy remains important army optimizing leader development effectiveness purpose exploratory case explore efficacy ce developing effective civilian leader performance completing course graduate dacs senior leader interviewed various background experience respect position interview used explore efficacy ce conduct interview researcher determined ce contributes graduate returned home station environment organization finding showed ce provide leadership development relevant training develop army civilian lead,"['largest', 'executive', 'federal', 'government', 'consisting', 'workforce', 'approximately', 'members', 'civilians', 'personnel', 'assigned', 'army', 'civilians', 'dac', 'annual', 'civilian', 'education', 'system', 'ces', 'intermediate', 'course', 'attendance', 'numbers', 'vary', 'organizations', 'larger', 'organizations', 'may', 'enroll', 'personnel', 'smaller', 'organizations', 'may', 'enroll', 'personnel', 'problem', 'existed', 'measured', 'efficacy', 'developing', 'effective', 'civilian', 'leaders', 'performance', 'completion', 'course', 'formal', 'measure', 'look', 'efficacy', 'course', 'significant', 'era', 'strategic', 'uncertainty', 'declining', 'expenditures', 'understanding', 'demonstrating', 'leader', 'development', 'course', 'efficacy', 'remains', 'important', 'army', 'optimizing', 'leader', 'development', 'effectiveness', 'purpose', 'exploratory', 'case', 'explore', 'efficacy', 'ces', 'developing', 'effective', 'civilian', 'leaders', 'performance', 'completing', 'course', 'graduates', 'dacs', 'senior', 'leaders', 'interviewed', 'various', 'backgrounds', 'experiences', 'respect', 'positions', 'interviews', 'used', 'explore', 'efficacy', 'ces', 'conduct', 'interviews', 'researcher', 'determined', 'ces', 'contributes', 'graduates', 'returned', 'home', 'station', 'environment', 'organization', 'findings', 'showed', 'ces', 'provide', 'leadership', 'development', 'relevant', 'training', 'develop', 'army', 'civilians', 'lead']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
U.S. Air Force Senior Enlisted Members’ Retirement Decisions and Job Embeddedness: A Generic Qualitative Inquiry,"Retaining a qualified and loyal workforce is important to public and private sector organizations. Turnover costs, while not wholly avoidable, are of significant interest to executives and human resource managers. However, research is needed to discover current influences that predict voluntary turnover. As society evolves, influences that affect employee’s motivation to remain with the organization are not relegated to how motivated they are to leave, but rather what motivates them to remain. Job embeddedness (JE) has emerged as a more comprehensive predictor of voluntary turnover compared to traditional measures of organizational commitment. There is limited research on JE for the public sector and even less research for public organizations like the Department of Defense. This research addresses the gap of limited research on job embeddedness for military populations in the public business sector, specifically enlisted populations in the United States Air Force. The research question for this study was: What evidence of job embeddedness collected from U.S. Air Force Senior Noncommissioned Officers (SNCO) influenced their retirement decisions? The study used a generic qualitative inquiry research method, a purposive sampling strategy, and a thematic data analysis technique. The 14 participant’s average ages were 45.5 years, and they served from 20 to 30 years in the United States Air Force. The purpose of this research study was to explore how JE contributes to USAF SNCOs’ retirement decisions. This study expands the knowledge of the role of links, fit, and sacrifice in SNCO retirement decisions. The major themes that emerged from the data were job satisfaction, opportunities, risks, motivation, and individual and family compatibility with the USAF. Marital status, generational norms, national political influences, and lack of innovation emerged as additional influences to JE. Future research of JE should evaluate the degree that these influences also affect the intent to stay in organizations.",2429066850,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Jones, Terran K.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2020," Enlisted , Job Embeddedness , Motivation , Public Service , Retirement Decision , Turnover", 9798662469723,,, English, English,,,,2020,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2020,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/u-s-air-force-senior-enlisted-members-retirement/docview/2429066850/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=U.S.+Air+Force+Senior+Enlisted+Members%E2%80%99+Retirement+Decisions+and+Job+Embeddedness%3A+A+Generic+Qualitative+Inquiry&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jones%2C+Terran+K.&amp;isbn=9798662469723&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",retaining qualified loyal workforce important public private sector organization turnover cost wholly avoidable significant interest executive human resource manager however needed discover current influence predict voluntary turnover society evolves influence affect employee motivation remain organization relegated motivated leave rather motivates remain job embeddedness emerged comprehensive predictor voluntary turnover compared traditional measure organizational commitment limited public sector even less public organization like address gap limited job embeddedness population public business sector specifically enlisted population united state air force question evidence job embeddedness collected air force senior noncommissioned officer snco influenced retirement decision used generic qualitative inquiry purposive sampling strategy thematic technique participant average age year served year united state air force purpose explore contributes usaf sncos retirement decision expands knowledge role link fit sacrifice snco retirement decision major theme emerged job satisfaction opportunity risk motivation individual family compatibility usaf marital status generational norm national political influence lack innovation emerged additional influence future evaluate degree influence also affect intent stay organization,"['retaining', 'qualified', 'loyal', 'workforce', 'important', 'public', 'private', 'sector', 'organizations', 'turnover', 'costs', 'wholly', 'avoidable', 'significant', 'interest', 'executives', 'human', 'resource', 'managers', 'however', 'needed', 'discover', 'current', 'influences', 'predict', 'voluntary', 'turnover', 'society', 'evolves', 'influences', 'affect', 'employee', 'motivation', 'remain', 'organization', 'relegated', 'motivated', 'leave', 'rather', 'motivates', 'remain', 'job', 'embeddedness', 'emerged', 'comprehensive', 'predictor', 'voluntary', 'turnover', 'compared', 'traditional', 'measures', 'organizational', 'commitment', 'limited', 'public', 'sector', 'even', 'less', 'public', 'organizations', 'like', 'addresses', 'gap', 'limited', 'job', 'embeddedness', 'populations', 'public', 'business', 'sector', 'specifically', 'enlisted', 'populations', 'united', 'states', 'air', 'force', 'question', 'evidence', 'job', 'embeddedness', 'collected', 'air', 'force', 'senior', 'noncommissioned', 'officers', 'snco', 'influenced', 'retirement', 'decisions', 'used', 'generic', 'qualitative', 'inquiry', 'purposive', 'sampling', 'strategy', 'thematic', 'data', 'technique', 'participant', 'average', 'ages', 'years', 'served', 'years', 'united', 'states', 'air', 'force', 'purpose', 'explore', 'contributes', 'usaf', 'sncos', 'retirement', 'decisions', 'expands', 'knowledge', 'role', 'links', 'fit', 'sacrifice', 'snco', 'retirement', 'decisions', 'major', 'themes', 'emerged', 'data', 'job', 'satisfaction', 'opportunities', 'risks', 'motivation', 'individual', 'family', 'compatibility', 'usaf', 'marital', 'status', 'generational', 'norms', 'national', 'political', 'influences', 'lack', 'innovation', 'emerged', 'additional', 'influences', 'future', 'evaluate', 'degree', 'influences', 'also', 'affect', 'intent', 'stay', 'organizations']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Academic Resilience: Experiences of Latino United States Army Active-Duty Soldiers and Veterans,"This critical ethnography evaluates Latino male active-duty soldiers' and veterans' experiences in higher education and the military setting through the lens of humanistic, psychosocial, and sociological perspectives with the purpose of finding out how these experiences contribute to their academic resilience. This study aims to answer questions about how internal and external resilience protective factors in the military and academic life contribute to the academic resilience of Latino military students, and evaluates if resilience can be taught in a military context. Through the lens of critical race theory (CRT) and the use of interviews with active-duty soldiers and veterans who attended 4-year institutions, the study looks for counter narratives emerging from their experiences to evaluate the patterns, practices, and policies of racial inequality that still exist in higher education and the U.S. Army that hinder the academic success of Latino military students. A total of 10 themes related to higher education, military life, and Latino culture emerged from the participants' experiences. Through the evaluation of these themes, the study found that being part of the U.S. Army may contribute to a higher level of academic resilience in military students, that resilience may be taught in a military context, and that racial inequality still exists in higher education and the U.S. Army that may hinder the academic success of Latino active-duty soldiers and veterans. In the future, higher education institutions and the U.S. military should collaborate to strengthen the soldiers' support system with the purpose of implementing best practices to help military students succeed academically.",2423562127,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Irizarry, Lourdes I.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2020," Academic resilience , Latino students , Military students , Racial inequality , Resilience", 9798662380851,,, English, English,,,,2020,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2020,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/academic-resilience-experiences-latino-united/docview/2423562127/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Academic+Resilience%3A+Experiences+of+Latino+United+States+Army+Active-Duty+Soldiers+and+Veterans&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Irizarry%2C+Lourdes+I.&amp;isbn=9798662380851&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,critical ethnography evaluates latino male soldier veteran experience higher education setting lens humanistic psychosocial sociological perspective purpose finding experience contribute academic resilience aim answer question internal external resilience protective factor academic life contribute academic resilience latino student evaluates resilience taught context lens critical race theory crt use interview soldier veteran attended institution look counter narrative emerging experience evaluate pattern practice policy racial inequality still exist higher education army hinder academic success latino student total theme related higher education life latino culture emerged participant experience evaluation theme found part army may contribute higher level academic resilience student resilience may taught context racial inequality still exists higher education army may hinder academic success latino soldier veteran future higher education institution collaborate strengthen soldier support system purpose implementing best practice help student succeed academically,"['critical', 'ethnography', 'evaluates', 'latino', 'male', 'soldiers', 'veterans', 'experiences', 'higher', 'education', 'setting', 'lens', 'humanistic', 'psychosocial', 'sociological', 'perspectives', 'purpose', 'finding', 'experiences', 'contribute', 'academic', 'resilience', 'aims', 'answer', 'questions', 'internal', 'external', 'resilience', 'protective', 'factors', 'academic', 'life', 'contribute', 'academic', 'resilience', 'latino', 'students', 'evaluates', 'resilience', 'taught', 'context', 'lens', 'critical', 'race', 'theory', 'crt', 'use', 'interviews', 'soldiers', 'veterans', 'attended', 'institutions', 'looks', 'counter', 'narratives', 'emerging', 'experiences', 'evaluate', 'patterns', 'practices', 'policies', 'racial', 'inequality', 'still', 'exist', 'higher', 'education', 'army', 'hinder', 'academic', 'success', 'latino', 'students', 'total', 'themes', 'related', 'higher', 'education', 'life', 'latino', 'culture', 'emerged', 'participants', 'experiences', 'evaluation', 'themes', 'found', 'part', 'army', 'may', 'contribute', 'higher', 'level', 'academic', 'resilience', 'students', 'resilience', 'may', 'taught', 'context', 'racial', 'inequality', 'still', 'exists', 'higher', 'education', 'army', 'may', 'hinder', 'academic', 'success', 'latino', 'soldiers', 'veterans', 'future', 'higher', 'education', 'institutions', 'collaborate', 'strengthen', 'soldiers', 'support', 'system', 'purpose', 'implementing', 'best', 'practices', 'help', 'students', 'succeed', 'academically']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Continuous Learning
"Leadership Styles, Employee Performance and Turnover within the Federal Government Information Technology Environment","Effective leadership plays an essential role in how any formal organization functions. It is a critical component in shaping an organization's culture and operational objectives. The foremost concern of this study was to explore the effects of leadership style on employee motivation and performance. Because leadership styles have an impact on an employee’s motivation and performance, the research showed employees tended to favor leadership style’s that were in alignment with earlier leadership styles, which they deemed positive and rejected those styles similar to those leadership styles they identified as unfavorable. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore the effects of leadership styles on employee motivation and performance within the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Information Technology environments. The study utilized phenomenological inquiry to investigate the perspective of employees and their perception of the relationship between their supervisor’s leadership style and their job satisfaction. One-on-one semi-structured interviews were used to ascertain whether or not leadership styles and mindfulness were having an impact on the employee’s decision to terminate his/her employment. The findings from the study suggested that while leadership styles had an effect on employee motivation, performance and turnover the level at which employees are cognizant of their implicit bias's referent to their leader's style and their ability to exercise mindfulness in any given situation may have a more significant impact on employee engagement (motivation, performance and, turnover). This qualitative case study provides awareness of the impact leadership styles, implicit biases, and mindfulness all have on employee motivation, performance, and turnover. Recommendations for future research are to analyze additional IT environments such as those existing within DoD, DoS, and other federal departments. Analyzing different agency IT environments could reveal whether or not employee perspectives on the effects of leadership style as it relates to motivation, performance, and turnover, are indeed intrinsic to the employee’s life experiences, or does the agency's culture play a significant role in the employee's experience.",2417509094,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Hernandez, Altanelle E.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

"Organizational Challenges and Concretion of Cybersecurity Education, Training, Exercises, and Performance Predictors Within the United States Department of Defense","The world has evolved over the past several decades whereby pervasive technology has fundamentally changed the way that humans interact with other humans and our physical environment. As society has moved towards a more net-centric existence, attackers are devoting ever increasing resources toward infiltration, compromise, and exploitation of interconnected systems. Furthermore, while these technologies have fundamentally changed the way that we live, we also now live in an age of information warfare and influence operations which can manipulate public sentiment, financial markets, global political events, and even the concept of truth itself. From a cybersecurity perspective, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) occupies a unique organizational niche within the federal government. From a purely defensive viewpoint and because of its size and scope, the DoD is a microcosm of society in regards to cybersecurity concerns. The DoD faces challenges in securing software and hardware used in its own enterprise networks and battle command systems, both classified and unclassified. It must also be concerned with securing communication mediums, mobile devices, web technologies, big data, and the ubiquitous challenge of the human user, all while existing as one of the governmental entities that is most frequently targeted by its adversaries. Additionally, the DoD has further challenges in securing cyber-physical systems such as critical infrastructure on military installations, security systems, building management systems, and even weapon platforms that incorporate elements of digital control systems. Finally, while trying to simultaneously grapple with its own cybersecurity concerns, the DoD is viewed as a supporting resource to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other governmental and nongovernmental entities. A unifying intersection of these concerns is the organizational challenges that the DoD faces in educating and training its cybersecurity workforce. In this thesis we will first discuss the DoD model for education and training of the DoD Cybersecurity Workforce, cyber-ranges, and collective cybersecurity training exercises. We then move on to examining data from two successive years of a DoD cybersecurity training exercise and look at how the data can help us to understand correlations between individual expertise factors and team performance in cyber defense, and analysis of team performance. The overall premise of this dissertation is whether it is possible that correlations and models of performance based upon education and training, expertise factors, and skills of the individual members may allow us to make more informed recommendations for future cybersecurity training and education.",2404611270,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Deckard, Gary Martin",,, Database copyright ProQuest

Examining the Relationship Between the Factors in Human Capital That Most Affect Organizational Performance,"Staff at a DON Agency (unnamed) within the Department of Defense anticipates a shortage of talents and skills in the next 3 or more consecutive years due to the retirement of the majority of its employees. The agency leaders adopted strategies needed to balance the competencies and skills required for the next generation of the workforce by providing training and career development initiatives, according to the Commander’s Guide in the 2013 records of the research study. The DON Agency leaders established robust and structured career development initiatives, such as mentoring, to ensure the transfer of knowledge and skills to the next generation of employees. The problem explored in this study was to identify and understand the key factors in the human capital arena that impact organizational performance and identify which of these factors are controllable. The impact of an effective career development program on overall organizational performance was identified in this study. Increasing employee awareness and participation had also been viewed as important in the success of career development initiatives. The study participants were federal employees, both appropriated and nonappropriated funded, assigned at the agency headquarter. The data collected combined observations, qualitative text-based document analysis, and qualitative interviews through focus group interviews. The themes and subthemes emerged from inductive reasoning, sorting, categorizing, and streamlining small sets of abstract through literature reviews on the works of other researchers, becoming the basis of a conceptual framework (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2005). The study implications included indications that the most effective career development program or best practice method that facilitated competency development, employee engagement, retention, and succession planning.",2382605982,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Sto.

The expression signatures in liver and adipose tissue from obese Göttingen Minipigs reveal a predisposition for healthy fat accumulation,"Background Model animals are valuable resources for dissecting basic aspects of the regulation of obesity and metabolism. The translatability of results relies on understanding comparative aspects of molecular pathophysiology. Several studies have shown that despite the presence of overt obesity and dyslipidemia in the pig key human pathological hepatic findings such as hepatocellular ballooning and abundant steatosis are lacking in the model. Objectives The aim of this study was to elucidate why these histopathological characteristics did not occur in a high fat, fructose and cholesterol (FFC) diet-induced obese Göttingen Minipig model. Methods High-throughput expression profiling of more than 90 metabolically relevant genes was performed in liver, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of male minipigs diet fed: standard chow (SD, n  = 7); FFC diet ( n  = 14); FFC diet in streptozotocin-induced diabetic pigs (FFC DIA , n  = 8). Moreover, histopathological assessment of SAT and VAT was performed. Results 12, 4 and 1 genes were highly significantly differentially expressed in liver, SAT and VAT when comparing the FFC and SD groups whereas the corresponding numbers were 15, 2, and 1 when comparing the FFC DIA and SD groups. Although the minipigs in both FFC groups developed sever obesity and dyslipidemia, the insulin-signaling pathways were not affected. Notably, four genes involved in lipid acquisition and removal, were highly deregulated in the liver: PPARG, LPL, CD36 and FABP4 . These genes have been reported to play a major role in promoting hepatic steatosis in rodents and humans. Since very little macrophage-associated pro-inflammatory response was detected in the adipose tissues the expansion appears to have no adverse impact on adipose tissue metabolism. Conclusion The study shows that morbidly obese Göttingen Minipigs are protected against many of the metabolic and hepatic abnormalities associated with obesity due to a remarkable ability to expand the adipose compartments to accommodate excess calories.",2382035120,,,Scholarly Journals," University of Copenhagen, Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Frederiksberg, Denmark (GRID:grid.5254.6) (ISNI:0000 0001 0674 042X) , University of Copenhagen, Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Frederiksberg, Denmark (GRID:grid.5254.6) (ISNI:0000 0001 0674 042X) , University of Copenhagen, Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Frederiksberg, Denmark (GRID:grid.5254.6) (ISNI:0000 0001 0674 042X) , University of Copenhagen, Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Frederiksberg, Denmark (GRID:grid.5254.6) (ISNI:0000 0001 0674 042X) , Global Drug Discovery, Novo Nordisk A/S, Måløv, Denmark (GRID:grid.425956.9) , Global Drug Discovery, Novo Nordisk A/S, Måløv, Denmark (GRID:grid.425956.9) , Global Drug Discovery, Novo Nordisk A/S, Måløv, Denmark (GRID:grid.425956.9) , Global Drug Discovery, Novo Nordisk A/S, Måløv, Denmark (GRID:grid.425956.9) , University of Copenhagen, Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Frederiksberg, Denmark (GRID:grid.5254.6) (ISNI:0000 0001 0674 042X); Ellegaard Gottingen Minipigs A/S, Dalmose, Denmark (GRID:grid.5254.6) , University of Copenhagen, Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Frederiksberg, Denmark (GRID:grid.5254.6) (ISNI:0000 0001 0674 042X) , University of Copenhagen, Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Frederiksberg, Denmark (GRID:grid.5254.6) (ISNI:0000 0001 0674 042X)","Cirera Susanna;Taşöz Emirhan;Juul Jacobsen Mette;Schumacher-Petersen, Camilla;Østergaard, Christoffersen Berit;Kaae, Kirk Rikke;Pagh Ludvigsen Trine;Hvid Henning;Duelund Pedersen Henrik;Høier Olsen Lisbeth;Fredholm Merete",,," This work is published under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ (the “License”).

Extrapolated from the work of Bejan and Zane and integrating social science research, it provides a foundational explanation of social rifts prevalent in many societies today as well as constructive efforts of social change, whether secular or religiously based. A primary example of constructive change explained by SAFT is the community-building work of the Bahá'í Faith, as reflected in both its teachings and its training institute process.",2405660036,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Gourdine, Christopher G;Edgren, Justin R;Trice, Thomas L;Zlatic, Joseph M",,, Copyright Association for Baha'i Studies Winter 2019,,, Journal Article,, Winter 2019," Interpersonal relationship , Social science",,0838-0430,4.0, English, English,, 53-82, Ottawa,Winter 2019,The Journal of Baha'i Studies,2019,,29.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/social-affinity-flow-theory-new-understanding/docview/2405660036/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Areligion&amp;atitle=Social+Affinity+Flow+Theory%3A+A+New+Understanding+of+Both+Human+Interaction+and+the+Power+of+the+Bah%26aacute%3B%27%26iacute%3B+Training+Institute+Process&amp;title=The+Journal+of+Baha%27i+Studies&amp;issn=08380430&amp;date=2019-12-01&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=53&amp;au=Gourdine%2C+Christopher+G%3BEdgren%2C+Justin+R%3BTrice%2C+Thomas+L%3BZlatic%2C+Joseph+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Journal+of+Baha%27i+Studies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,article present new theoretical construct social affinity flow theory saft describes predicts flow phenomenon across diversity human social system founded upon constructal law constructal law associated describe many phenomenon nature human society extrapolated work bejan zane integrating social science provides foundational explanation social rift prevalent many society today well constructive effort social change whether secular religiously based primary example constructive change explained saft work bahá faith reflected teaching training institute process,"['article', 'presents', 'new', 'theoretical', 'construct', 'social', 'affinity', 'flow', 'theory', 'saft', 'describes', 'predicts', 'flow', 'phenomena', 'across', 'diversity', 'human', 'social', 'systems', 'founded', 'upon', 'constructal', 'law', 'constructal', 'law', 'associated', 'describe', 'many', 'phenomena', 'nature', 'human', 'societies', 'extrapolated', 'work', 'bejan', 'zane', 'integrating', 'social', 'science', 'provides', 'foundational', 'explanation', 'social', 'rifts', 'prevalent', 'many', 'societies', 'today', 'well', 'constructive', 'efforts', 'social', 'change', 'whether', 'secular', 'religiously', 'based', 'primary', 'example', 'constructive', 'change', 'explained', 'saft', 'work', 'bahá', 'faith', 'reflected', 'teachings', 'training', 'institute', 'process']",Journal Article,0,Process Improvement

Improving Information Flows in the Production Planning Process: Proposal of a Dashboard Based on KPIs,"Technological evolution is currently triggering changes in companies’ practices as well as in the environment they operate. This dynamic has led companies to rethink the way they work, trying to, continuously, improve their processes as a way of gaining efficiency and competitiveness. This report presents a study developed in a sanitary systems multinational manufacturer, more specifically in its production planning and control department, with a focus on improving its information processes. The main goal of this project was to reduce the existing inefficiencies associated to the production planning information flows, using, for that purpose, process mapping tools, as well as waste analyses techniques. While BPMN 2.0 was the language chosen to map the processes, identify the data sources and information flows; Lean tools were used to identify non-value-added activities and, consequently, waste present in the processes. As proof of concept, Microsoft Power BI tool was used as a base for and Information System, guided by Industry 4.0 principles and needs. The main practical contribution of this work should be that this solution, which integrates people, data, flows and processes, may contribute to efficiency gains in the daily tasks of the planners, in the decision-making processes and in the identification and elimination of non-value-added activities, improving the global planning performance.",3086167358,, <html><head><meta name='ValidationSchema' content='http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd'/><title></title></head><body>Melhoria dos Fluxos de Informação no Processo de Planeamento da Produção: Proposta de uma Dashboard Suportada em KPIs</body></html>,Dissertations & Theses,,"de Melo Pascoal Arromba, Ana Rita",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2019,, 9798383488072,,, English, English, <html><head><meta name='ValidationSchema' content='http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd'/><title></title></head><body>Melhoria dos Fluxos de Informação no Processo de Planeamento da Produção: Proposta de uma Dashboard Suportada em KPIs</body></html>,,,2019,PQDT - Global,2019,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/improving-information-flows-production-planning/docview/3086167358/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Improving+Information+Flows+in+the+Production+Planning+Process%3A+Proposal+of+a+Dashboard+Based+on+KPIs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=de+Melo+Pascoal+Arromba%2C+Ana+Rita&amp;isbn=9798383488072&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,technological evolution currently triggering change company practice well environment operate dynamic led company rethink way work trying continuously improve process way gaining efficiency competitiveness report present developed sanitary system multinational manufacturer specifically production planning control focus improving information process main goal project reduce existing inefficiency associated production planning information flow using purpose process mapping tool well waste analysis technique bpmn language chosen map process identify source information flow lean tool used identify activity consequently waste present process proof concept microsoft power tool used base information system guided industry principle need main practical contribution work solution integrates people flow process may contribute efficiency gain daily task planner process identification elimination activity improving global planning performance,"['technological', 'evolution', 'currently', 'triggering', 'changes', 'companies', 'practices', 'well', 'environment', 'operate', 'dynamic', 'led', 'companies', 'rethink', 'way', 'work', 'trying', 'continuously', 'improve', 'processes', 'way', 'gaining', 'efficiency', 'competitiveness', 'report', 'presents', 'developed', 'sanitary', 'systems', 'multinational', 'manufacturer', 'specifically', 'production', 'planning', 'control', 'focus', 'improving', 'information', 'processes', 'main', 'goal', 'project', 'reduce', 'existing', 'inefficiencies', 'associated', 'production', 'planning', 'information', 'flows', 'using', 'purpose', 'process', 'mapping', 'tools', 'well', 'waste', 'analyses', 'techniques', 'bpmn', 'language', 'chosen', 'map', 'processes', 'identify', 'data', 'sources', 'information', 'flows', 'lean', 'tools', 'used', 'identify', 'activities', 'consequently', 'waste', 'present', 'processes', 'proof', 'concept', 'microsoft', 'power', 'tool', 'used', 'base', 'information', 'system', 'guided', 'industry', 'principles', 'needs', 'main', 'practical', 'contribution', 'work', 'solution', 'integrates', 'people', 'data', 'flows', 'processes', 'may', 'contribute', 'efficiency', 'gains', 'daily', 'tasks', 'planners', 'processes', 'identification', 'elimination', 'activities', 'improving', 'global', 'planning', 'performance']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement
Information Systems Driven to Decision Support and Institutions’ Success in the Higher Education Context Exploring key antecedents through a technology acceptance perspective,"The main aim of this Ph.D. thesis in Management is to provide better understanding of the role of Information Systems (ISs) in the decision-making process and successful performance of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), exploring the antecedents of technology acceptance. To achieve the objectives defined, four articles were elaborated: a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and three articles of an empirical nature. Therefore, the first article aimed to identify, explore and systematize the main topics regarding the role of web portals as tools to support information management in HEIs. Based on 126 articles published up to 5 November 2016 on the Web of Science and SCOPUS databases, four major topics were identified, namely, the software used in web portals, internal and external benefits of using web portals, technology acceptance and information storage and management. The main contribution of this research lies in identifying the main topics and trends in scientific production for each topic identified, and in identifying gaps and future lines of research in this field of study. The second article aimed to study the influence of web portals in supporting HEI management and performance, considering personality traits, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, through an empirical study. To achieve the aim proposed, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used together with a structured questionnaire administered to teaching and non-teaching staff in Portuguese HEIs. The results obtained, through 338 valid responses, indicate a positive influence of personality traits on the use of web portals and that their use also has a positive influence on HEIs’ performance. The third chapter sought to identify the factors influencing the use of e-learning platforms in the Portuguese academic context through an empirical study. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information. Based on 631 valid responses, SEM was applied, leading to the conclusion that, in accordance with Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), the characteristics of e-learning platforms and Personal Innovativeness in Information Technology (PIIT) have a positive influence on the use of this tool. The fourth and final article aimed to identify and explain the factors of successful operation, implementation and use of e-libraries in the academic context of Portuguese higher education. To achieve this goal, a qualitative approach was adopted, through a case study of the e-library at the University of Beira Interior (UBI). Primary data were obtained from interviews with staff of the library, computer services and administration of this teaching institution holding leadership positions and directly involved in the implementation, maintenance or use of the e-library. The empirical evidence highlights the importance of minimizing costs, particularly by forming cooperation protocols, the use of open-source software and training of UBI library staff. Acceptance and use of the e-library depends on the platform’s characteristics, the ease of access to information, actions to publicise and make the whole academic community aware of the e-library and its functions, and implementation of appealing, intuitive User Interfaces (UIs). In addition, the training of students and library staff was revealed as a relevant factor for acceptance of this tool. For the future, the creation of a functional search aggregator is suggested, to allow a simultaneous search in all the databases and creating the least noise possible. This function could be implemented based on multi-disciplinary teams with skills acquired through specific training. This study was based on Resource-Based View (RBV) and Social Learning Theory (SLT). In this thesis, considering the four studies developed, it was possible to support the influence of IS acceptance on HEIs’ performance and determine the role of ISs in supporting these institutions’ management, in the Portuguese academic context.

A Balance of Design Methodology for Enterprise Quality Attribute Consideration in System-Of-Systems Architecting,"An objective of System-of-Systems (SoS) engineering work in the Defense community is to ensure optimal delivery of operational capabilities to warfighters in the face of finite resources and constantly changing conditions. Assurance of enterprise-level capabilities for operational users in the Defense community presents a challenge for acquisitions in balancing multiple SoS architectures versus the more traditional system-based optimization. The problem is exacerbated by the complexity of SoS being realized by multiple, heterogeneous, independently-managed systems that interact to provide these capabilities. Furthermore, the comparison of candidate SoS architectures for selection of the design that satisfies the most enterprise-level objectives and how such decisions affect the future solution space lead to additional challenges in applying existing frameworks. As a result of the enormous challenge associated with enterprise capability development, this research proposes an enterprise architecting methodology leveraging SoS architecture data in the context of multiple enterprise-level objectives to enable the definition of candidate architectures for comparison and decision-making. In this context, architecture-based quality attributes of the enterprise (e.g., resilience, agility, changeability) must be considered. This research builds and extends previous SoS engineering work in the Department of Defense (DoD) to develop a process framework that can improve the analysis of architectural attributes within an enterprise. Certain system attributes of interest are quantified using selected Quality Attributes (QAts). The proposed process framework enables the identification of the quality attributes of interest as the desired characteristics to be balanced against performance measures. QAts are used to derive operational activities as well as design techniques for employment against an as-is SoS architecture. These activities and techniques are then mapped to metrics used to compare alternative architectures. These alternatives enable an SoS-based balance of design for performance and quality attribute optimization while employing a capability model to provide a comparison of available alternatives against overarching preferences. Approaches are then examined to analyze performance of the alternatives in meeting the enterprise capability objectives. These results are synthesized to enable an analysis of alternatives (AoA) to produce a should-be architecture vector based on a selected to-be architecture. A comparison of the vector trade space is discussed as a forward work in relation to the original enterprise level objectives for decision-making. The framework is illustrated using three case studies including a DoD Satellite Communications (SATCOM) case study; Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) case study; and a satellite operations as a service case study. For the SATCOM case study specifically, the question is considered of whether a certain QAt—resilience—can best be achieved through design alternatives of satellite disaggregation or diversification. The analysis shows that based on the metric mapping and design alternatives examined, diversification provides the greatest SATCOM capability improvement compared to the base architecture, while also enhancing resilience. These three separate cases studies show the framework can be extended to address multiple similar issues with system characteristics and SoS architecture questions for a wide range of enterprises.",2376780799,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Nelson, Travis J.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,

Exploring the Perspectives from Records Management Personnel: The Challenges of Electronic Health Records Management,"In 2009, the U.S. government allocated $36 billion to the creation of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical (HITECH) Act. HITECH was a means to transform the quality of health care through information technology and the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs). The Act accompanied the ongoing nationwide dissemination of EHR implementation within public health care systems and the U.S. Department of Defense’s branches of military service. The purpose of this study was to explore how and why records management personnel faced challenges in switching from paper-based medical records (PBMRs) to EHRs. This qualitative exploratory study uncovered the perspectives of nine key informants at a U.S. Army hospital: the medical records technicians responsible for transitioning from PBMRs to EHRs. Five themes emerged from participants' interviews about their experiences with PBMRs and EHRs. The information gained provided a view of the perspectives of MRTs, much-needed information in response to the lack of literature regarding records transition in an Army hospital outpatient medical records department. Findings from this study provide valuable information for stakeholders, leaders, and medical business administrators managing patients’ medical records in any medical environment. Results contribute perspectives of MRT participants regarding the challenges of using EHRs in a military hospital.",2366554826,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Westmoreland, William C.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2019," Electronic health records , Health information technology , Key informant sampling , MEDDAC , Paper-based medical records (PBMR) , Health Information Technology for Economic &amp; Clinical Health (HITECH) Act", 9781392510896,,, English, English,,,,2019,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2019,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploring-perspectives-records-management/docview/2366554826/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploring+the+Perspectives+from+Records+Management+Personnel%3A+The+Challenges+of+Electronic+Health+Records+Management&amp;issn=&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Westmoreland%2C+William+C.&amp;isbn=9781392510896&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",government allocated billion creation health information technology economic clinical hitech act hitech mean transform quality health care information technology adoption electronic health record ehrs act accompanied ongoing nationwide dissemination ehr implementation within public health care system branch service purpose explore record management personnel faced challenge switching medical record pbmrs ehrs qualitative exploratory uncovered perspective nine key informant army hospital medical record technician responsible transitioning pbmrs ehrs five theme emerged participant interview experience pbmrs ehrs information gained provided view perspective mrts information response lack literature regarding record transition army hospital outpatient medical record finding provide valuable information stakeholder leader medical business administrator managing patient medical record medical environment result contribute perspective mrt participant regarding challenge using ehrs hospital,"['government', 'allocated', 'billion', 'creation', 'health', 'information', 'technology', 'economic', 'clinical', 'hitech', 'act', 'hitech', 'means', 'transform', 'quality', 'health', 'care', 'information', 'technology', 'adoption', 'electronic', 'health', 'records', 'ehrs', 'act', 'accompanied', 'ongoing', 'nationwide', 'dissemination', 'ehr', 'implementation', 'within', 'public', 'health', 'care', 'systems', 'branches', 'service', 'purpose', 'explore', 'records', 'management', 'personnel', 'faced', 'challenges', 'switching', 'medical', 'records', 'pbmrs', 'ehrs', 'qualitative', 'exploratory', 'uncovered', 'perspectives', 'nine', 'key', 'informants', 'army', 'hospital', 'medical', 'records', 'technicians', 'responsible', 'transitioning', 'pbmrs', 'ehrs', 'five', 'themes', 'emerged', 'participants', 'interviews', 'experiences', 'pbmrs', 'ehrs', 'information', 'gained', 'provided', 'view', 'perspectives', 'mrts', 'information', 'response', 'lack', 'literature', 'regarding', 'records', 'transition', 'army', 'hospital', 'outpatient', 'medical', 'records', 'findings', 'provide', 'valuable', 'information', 'stakeholders', 'leaders', 'medical', 'business', 'administrators', 'managing', 'patients', 'medical', 'records', 'medical', 'environment', 'results', 'contribute', 'perspectives', 'mrt', 'participants', 'regarding', 'challenges', 'using', 'ehrs', 'hospital']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Too Agile? - DevOps Software Development Challenges in a Military Environment,"Agile and DevOps software development processes now represent proven, commonly accepted models in commercial industry. For DoD military environments however, empowering teams of software developers and end user operators to build, test and release solutions without direct oversight and management of leadership is a brand new experience. In 2017, a DoD software acquisitions revolution occurred when approval was granted to scrap the former ineffective, cost prohibitive process and initiate the agile DevOps model. After one year since its introduction, this paper may represent the very first look at how well this nontraditional process is working out in a military command and control (C2) environment. More specifically, the study attempts to answer concerns by an USAF air operations center (AOC) headquarters that the process may not be delivering value to end user operators.",2307397860,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Kenner, Burl T., III",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2019," Agile , Air Operations Center (AOC) , Command and Control (C2) , DevOps , DoD Acquisitions , Software Development", 9781687952028,,, English, English,,,,2019,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2019,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/too-agile-devops-software-development-challenges/docview/2307397860/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Too+Agile%3F+-+DevOps+Software+Development+Challenges+in+a+Military+Environment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kenner%2C+Burl+T.%2C+III&amp;isbn=9781687952028&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",agile devops software development process represent proven commonly accepted model commercial industry environment however empowering team software developer end user operator build test release solution without direct oversight management leadership brand new experience software acquisition revolution occurred approval granted scrap former ineffective cost prohibitive process initiate agile devops model one year since introduction may represent first look well nontraditional process working command control environment specifically attempt answer concern usaf air operation center aoc headquarters process may delivering value end user operator,"['agile', 'devops', 'software', 'development', 'processes', 'represent', 'proven', 'commonly', 'accepted', 'models', 'commercial', 'industry', 'environments', 'however', 'empowering', 'teams', 'software', 'developers', 'end', 'user', 'operators', 'build', 'test', 'release', 'solutions', 'without', 'direct', 'oversight', 'management', 'leadership', 'brand', 'new', 'experience', 'software', 'acquisitions', 'revolution', 'occurred', 'approval', 'granted', 'scrap', 'former', 'ineffective', 'cost', 'prohibitive', 'process', 'initiate', 'agile', 'devops', 'model', 'one', 'year', 'since', 'introduction', 'may', 'represent', 'first', 'look', 'well', 'nontraditional', 'process', 'working', 'command', 'control', 'environment', 'specifically', 'attempts', 'answer', 'concerns', 'usaf', 'air', 'operations', 'center', 'aoc', 'headquarters', 'process', 'may', 'delivering', 'value', 'end', 'user', 'operators']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
Technical Reviews in Complex Development Programs,"Technical reviews in major complex defense and space projects are high-stakes events that technically assess programs costing up to billions of dollars, probing the work of hundreds of engineers. These technical reviews evolved since the 1960s into an industry-standard systems engineering process. Prior research argues that technical reviews at the subsystem level are the most technically important—conflicting with other work positing that mission-level technical reviews critically contribute to failures of government programs. Reviews are important, but research on reviews is inconsistent, fragmented, and lacks supporting data. To understand the practice of technical reviews and the alignment between practice and literature, this research was split into three related questions: (1) How do technical reviews impact subsequent project engineering and management activities? (2) How do technical reviews affect participant views and self-reported knowledge of the project? (3) How do the findings from the above questions compare with literature or extant theory? The research found, unexpectedly, that system-level reviews are fundamentally different from subsystem reviews in what they do for stakeholders: subsystem reviews better meet the technological needs of the design team, while system-level reviews better meet the system-level integration and external stakeholder needs. Stakeholders have strong preferences for the reviews that meet their needs; thus, design team members prefer subsystem reviews, and stakeholders external to the project prefer system-level reviews. This preference explains the conflicts in prior research on ``what is important about reviews'': it depends on who you ask. It also points to a problem in current ``best practice'': almost all industry standards treat subsystem reviews as ``system-level reviews but smaller.'' Ignoring the key differences of subsystem reviews is a significant misunderstanding and gap in the literature. The author of this report used a case-based qualitative research approach. Six specific cases of DoD / NASA spacecraft technical reviews were studied, covering two key dimensions of expected variability: phase of design and level of review . Project data and review observations were used to develop questions for 25 interviews of project members about technical reviews. Interview respondents were solicited to span a third study variable of participant role . Interview data were analyzed using standard qualitative analysis methods to develop common findings on how reviews impact project work and participant knowledge. A follow-on systematic literature review and analysis developed a literature database of over 300 sources on reviews. An assessment was conducted of the relevant support in the literature for the research findings.",2275127664,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Braunger, Robert M.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Integrating Health Care Systems to Maintain Quality Care and to Manage Cost,"The rising cost of health care in the Philippines is a concern for the Department of Defense and TRICARE beneficiaries. The purpose of this quantitative cross-sectional research study was to determine the efficacy and acceptability of a different method to deliver health care to increase access to health care and decrease out-of-pocket costs while maintaining quality of care for TOP Standard beneficiaries who receive health care under the Philippine Demonstration. Secondary data was used to determine the acceptability of an alternative reimbursement methodology to decrease cost but maintain access to quality care. The Andersen's behavioral health care model and the Donabedian quality health care model were used to interpret the study results. A data set of 180 participants was evaluated using a cross-sectional quantitative methodology. Two Spearman correlations were used to examine the relationship between financial burden and satisfaction (r = .41, p &lt; .001) and financial burden and confidence (r = .44, p &lt; .001). Linear and binary regressions assessed the effects of age and gender on satisfaction with health care finder functionality when requesting a waiver (F (2,26) = 1.22, p = .313, R2 = .09). A computation of one-sample t-tests to determine the impact of a closed network, beneficiary out-of-pocket cost, and quality health care in Demonstration areas found the beneficiaries were satisfied with the demonstration. An analysis of the claims data pre and post demonstration showed a difference in the patients' out-of-pocket expenses and the acceptability and preference for a closed network. Social change was demonstrated by a decrease in the cost for TRICARE standard beneficiaries in the Philippines.",2228850854,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Noble, Marilynn J.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2019," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Access to care , Avedis donabedian , Closed network , Out-of-pocket costs , Philippines , Ronald andersen", 978-1-392-13978-3,,, English, English,,,,2019,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2019,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/integrating-health-care-systems-maintain-quality/docview/2228850854/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Integrating+Health+Care+Systems+to+Maintain+Quality+Care+and+to+Manage+Cost&amp;issn=&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Noble%2C+Marilynn+J.&amp;isbn=978-1-392-13978-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Health Research Premium Collection, ProQuest One Academic",rising cost health care philippine concern tricare beneficiary purpose quantitative determine efficacy acceptability different deliver health care increase access health care decrease cost maintaining quality care top standard beneficiary receive health care philippine demonstration secondary used determine acceptability alternative reimbursement decrease cost maintain access quality care andersen behavioral health care model donabedian quality health care model used interpret result set participant evaluated using quantitative two spearman correlation used examine relationship financial burden satisfaction financial burden confidence linear binary regression assessed effect age gender satisfaction health care finder functionality requesting waiver computation determine impact closed network beneficiary cost quality health care demonstration area found beneficiary satisfied demonstration claim pre post demonstration showed difference patient expense acceptability preference closed network social change demonstrated decrease cost tricare standard beneficiary philippine,"['rising', 'cost', 'health', 'care', 'philippines', 'concern', 'tricare', 'beneficiaries', 'purpose', 'quantitative', 'determine', 'efficacy', 'acceptability', 'different', 'deliver', 'health', 'care', 'increase', 'access', 'health', 'care', 'decrease', 'costs', 'maintaining', 'quality', 'care', 'top', 'standard', 'beneficiaries', 'receive', 'health', 'care', 'philippine', 'demonstration', 'secondary', 'data', 'used', 'determine', 'acceptability', 'alternative', 'reimbursement', 'decrease', 'cost', 'maintain', 'access', 'quality', 'care', 'andersen', 'behavioral', 'health', 'care', 'model', 'donabedian', 'quality', 'health', 'care', 'model', 'used', 'interpret', 'results', 'data', 'set', 'participants', 'evaluated', 'using', 'quantitative', 'two', 'spearman', 'correlations', 'used', 'examine', 'relationship', 'financial', 'burden', 'satisfaction', 'financial', 'burden', 'confidence', 'linear', 'binary', 'regressions', 'assessed', 'effects', 'age', 'gender', 'satisfaction', 'health', 'care', 'finder', 'functionality', 'requesting', 'waiver', 'computation', 'determine', 'impact', 'closed', 'network', 'beneficiary', 'cost', 'quality', 'health', 'care', 'demonstration', 'areas', 'found', 'beneficiaries', 'satisfied', 'demonstration', 'claims', 'data', 'pre', 'post', 'demonstration', 'showed', 'difference', 'patients', 'expenses', 'acceptability', 'preference', 'closed', 'network', 'social', 'change', 'demonstrated', 'decrease', 'cost', 'tricare', 'standard', 'beneficiaries', 'philippines']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Process Improvement
IT Project Managers' Education and Certification Impact on Project Success: A Comparative Study,"This study posited that a relationship exists between information technology (IT) project managers’ technical education and commercial project management certification and project management success, also known as project efficiency, for Department of Defense (DoD) IT project managers (PMs). Specifically, this research asked, “To what extent does project management success in scope, schedule, and cost compare with PMs with STEM and non-STEM education?” “To what extent does project management success compare with PMs with a commercial certification and without a commercial certification?” “To what extent do interaction between education type (STEM and non-STEM) and commercial certification compare with project management success?” A gap in research exists on whether IT PMs with a technical education positively impact project outcomes. The IT PM community needs more studies on the extent to which commercial PM certifications impact project efficiency. The literature search failed to yield any studies on how interactive effects of IT PM technical education and certification impact project efficiency. This research used factorial multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to compare education and PM certification to project efficiency. MANOVA provided for the examination of the interactive effects. The population of DoD IT PMs includes 24,534 program/project managers and information technology members, 74% male, with varying education types and PM certifications. The sample of 284 DoD IT PMs collected via Internet survey was representative of the population with 75% male respondents. MANOVA tested the research question hypotheses. A Mann-Whitney post hoc test confirmed the MANOVA results. Both tests concluded that no relationship exists between undergraduate STEM education and commercial PM certification and project outcomes on scope, schedule, and cost. This study suggests that organizations should recruit project managers with either a STEM or non-STEM degree. To improve IT project efficiency, this study suggests that organizations should not make the attainment of commercial PM certification compulsory, as the benefits balance tilts more toward the individual’s career than project management success. Voluntary commercial PM certifications do have value for the individual PM interested in career advancement. Further research is recommended using secondary data.",2224552010,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Parker, William J.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual

An Exploration of the Influence Afloat Maintenance has on the 21st Century Naval Sailor's Reenlistment Decision,"Although the U.S. Navy has schools that enable boot camp graduates to complete the Sailorization process and transforms them into active-duty service members, life skills training that focuses on developing resiliency and toughness in new accessions and preparing them for the rigors and demands of service in afloat naval commands does not exist. Similarly, during periods of lengthy maintenance for afloat naval commands sailors’ ability to perform their tasks in the scope of their trained occupational specialty is challenged. Maintenance availability periods are a vulnerable time for first-term enlisted sailors, and their mentorship and development must become a command's priority if the goal is to retain trained personnel. This mixed methods study analyzed first-term enlisted sailor retention for ashore and afloat commands and emphasized the effect periods of constant maintenance had on retention. The second phase of research included analysis of interview transcripts for sailors and ombudsman in Mayport and Norfolk, eliciting feedback that may stimulate recognition from military policymakers. Findings show that afloat command maintenance availabilities greater than 180 consecutive days negatively impact retention and surprisingly, retention for first-term enlisted sailors assigned to afloat commands yielded higher retention than ashore commands. A textual analysis of the challenges identified by sailors added depth to the quantitative findings and prompted the creation of a design model focused on restructuring educational systems supporting A-school as well as job training efforts to develop tough sailors who are resilient and prepared for service in a dynamic afloat command environment.",2217169942,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Wijnaldum, Kathryn Sampson",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2019," Education , A-school , Attrition , Maintenance , Reenlistment , Sailor , U.s. navy", 978-1-392-07634-7,,, English, English,,,,2019,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2019,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploration-influence-afloat-maintenance-has-on/docview/2217169942/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+Exploration+of+the+Influence+Afloat+Maintenance+has+on+the+21st+Century+Naval+Sailor%27s+Reenlistment+Decision&amp;issn=&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wijnaldum%2C+Kathryn+Sampson&amp;isbn=978-1-392-07634-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,although navy school enable boot camp graduate complete sailorization process transforms service member life skill training focus developing resiliency toughness new accession preparing rigor demand service afloat naval command exist similarly period lengthy maintenance afloat naval command sailor ability perform task scope trained occupational specialty challenged maintenance availability period vulnerable time enlisted sailor mentorship development must become command priority goal retain trained personnel mixed method analyzed enlisted sailor retention ashore afloat command emphasized effect period constant maintenance retention second phase included interview transcript sailor ombudsman mayport norfolk eliciting feedback may stimulate recognition policymakers finding show afloat command maintenance availability greater consecutive day negatively impact retention surprisingly retention enlisted sailor assigned afloat command yielded higher retention ashore command textual challenge identified sailor added depth quantitative finding prompted creation design model focused restructuring educational system supporting well job training effort develop tough sailor resilient prepared service dynamic afloat command environment,"['although', 'navy', 'schools', 'enable', 'boot', 'camp', 'graduates', 'complete', 'sailorization', 'process', 'transforms', 'service', 'members', 'life', 'skills', 'training', 'focuses', 'developing', 'resiliency', 'toughness', 'new', 'accessions', 'preparing', 'rigors', 'demands', 'service', 'afloat', 'naval', 'commands', 'exist', 'similarly', 'periods', 'lengthy', 'maintenance', 'afloat', 'naval', 'commands', 'sailors', 'ability', 'perform', 'tasks', 'scope', 'trained', 'occupational', 'specialty', 'challenged', 'maintenance', 'availability', 'periods', 'vulnerable', 'time', 'enlisted', 'sailors', 'mentorship', 'development', 'must', 'become', 'command', 'priority', 'goal', 'retain', 'trained', 'personnel', 'mixed', 'methods', 'analyzed', 'enlisted', 'sailor', 'retention', 'ashore', 'afloat', 'commands', 'emphasized', 'effect', 'periods', 'constant', 'maintenance', 'retention', 'second', 'phase', 'included', 'interview', 'transcripts', 'sailors', 'ombudsman', 'mayport', 'norfolk', 'eliciting', 'feedback', 'may', 'stimulate', 'recognition', 'policymakers', 'findings', 'show', 'afloat', 'command', 'maintenance', 'availabilities', 'greater', 'consecutive', 'days', 'negatively', 'impact', 'retention', 'surprisingly', 'retention', 'enlisted', 'sailors', 'assigned', 'afloat', 'commands', 'yielded', 'higher', 'retention', 'ashore', 'commands', 'textual', 'challenges', 'identified', 'sailors', 'added', 'depth', 'quantitative', 'findings', 'prompted', 'creation', 'design', 'model', 'focused', 'restructuring', 'educational', 'systems', 'supporting', 'well', 'job', 'training', 'efforts', 'develop', 'tough', 'sailors', 'resilient', 'prepared', 'service', 'dynamic', 'afloat', 'command', 'environment']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Continuous Learning
A Proposed Knowledge Management Portal for Sharing Information within a Government Organization,"Billions of dollars are spent by government organizations to accomplish their mission. Organizations are faced with the increased growth of complex software systems to handle higher velocity, volume, and variety of data captured at higher speeds to achieve mission goals. Software and hardware evolution continue to drive challenges in modifying legacy systems towards dependability and autonomy while forcing a change in software developers verification and validation approaches from traditional acquisition development methodology (waterfall, “V,” incremental, etc.) to agile and DevOps. At the same time, government organizations are wrestling with a tremendous technical change in the acquisition lifecycle process as they adopt Open System Architectures to meet the surge in cross-team interoperability while balancing budgetary constraints as they move towards a modernization strategy. A significant concern is the development of learning mechanisms to preserve organizational and programmatic knowledge, in the face of a transitory workforce, to improve information sharing as the organization undergoes enterprise evolution. For over a decade, the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) Systems Engineering Division repeatedly recommended the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other government organizations integrate systems engineering (SE) and collaborative methods and tools throughout system acquisitions to better manage risk. A common theme reported in the findings is that insufficient understanding of both the individual and System-of-System (SoS) interdependency of product, process, and people/organizational environments affect information sharing. A similar note is taken in GAO-0615, GAO-09-1011T, and GAO-12-1022 to highlight the lack of interagency collaboration mechanisms. This praxis assesses cross-organizational links among three Elements of an acquisition organization using Social Network Analysis (SNA) to gain insight into their heuristic relationships and examines the human factors impacting process integration and collaboration in the “as-is” network. A Knowledge Management System (KMS) is introduced in a “to-be” network to investigate the probability of improving information sharing between three Elements in the network. The KMS is developed using ten criteria and five sub-criteria based on insight from literature reviews and substantiated by experts from the three Element and industry leaders. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model aggregates the expert judgments to analyze the probability of implementing the KMS. An outline of a web-based knowledge portal leveraging the integration of current disparate tools into a “total system” approach to enable knowledge capture and information distribution is shown in Appendix 3. The primary objective for implementing a KMS is to allow seamless communication between teams allowing Communities of Practice (CoP) and management to observe and analyze the enterprise in a holistic manner to manage interdependencies with fact-based data integrated into metrics to make insightful decisions.",2169476134,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Padmore, Leslie Malik",,, Database copyright

Uncovering Hidden Patterns of Thought in War: Wei-Chi versus Chess,"We use metaphors and analogies to help us connect the dots and uncover hidden patterns of thought. They provide us with a way to go far beyond the meaning of words and are tools guiding the manner in which we think and act. Gen. David Perkins describes how the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command is preparing the Army for the future of warfare in Big Picture, Not Details, Key When Eyeing Future. Perkins is attempting to use an argument from analogy; however, this is a false analogy.

Using Actual Results to Actually Improve Acquisition,"Cost overruns are bad for the Department of Defense (DoD). They cause stress, uncertainty, lost opportunity cost, bad publicity, and reduced capability in the war-fighters' hands. Over the last decade, something new and good has happened in DoD acquisition, which needs to be noted and reinforced. This new development has led to measurable improvement in the control of cost and schedule of major acquisition programs across the DoD, and it is important we understand its role.

Analysis of Fashion E-Commerce Data to Promote Process Strategical Improvements,"Digital commerce is one of the most addressed topics in luxury businesses. The innovation of this sector can and must be a path to obtain high profits. Farfetch, which is currently a worldwide success, was created upon the realization of the rising interest and fascination regarding electronic commerce. Nowadays, with an increasing competitive market in this sector, it becomes essential to adopt strategies to value companies in relation to their competitors. In the case of large companies, which are responsible for a huge amount of data, it is interesting to convert these in useful knowledge to the business and adopt strategies to improve processes.The present dissertation was developed in the centre of digital production of an online luxury sale company. After data analysis referring to previous years, it was observed that stock times between the different phases of the process were too expensive, that the computer systems had defects with impact on cycle times and that there was a high variability regarding the productivity of collaborators. The focus of this dissertation was thus to perform a more detailed analysis of all the processes and to suggest strategical improvements of the latter. Two different studies were performed to achieve such. One focused on understanding how the cycle time of the station with higher impact on the process fluctuated, and how it could be reduced. The second aimed to reuse the high stock time to perform activities in parallel, that although obligatory, can be executed at any stage of the process. Using a multivariate linear regression in the first study, it was understood that adding a new item with a different category to a same slot increases the cycle time of the station in 2.960 minutes, while adding an extra item increases it in 2.899 minutes. It was suggested that the items started to be organized by categories and not by lot, so that each work post would produce two different categories at most. This would necessarily create the need for a triage station to reorganize the items by slot again, and allow them to proceed to the boutiques. The second study allowed to realise that the stations’ stock times can be used to enter the information of the items at the company’s software, therefore reducing the process time of the items up until 13%. One of the already existing stations would then have to be divided in two new ones: one that could be executed at any time of the process and another that would necessarily have to be performed after the items’ shooting.",3086163420,, <html><head><meta name='ValidationSchema' content='http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd'/><title></title></head><body>Análise de Dados de uma Empresa de Comércio Eletrónico de Moda para Promover Melhorias Estratégicas Nos Processos</body></html>,Dissertations & Theses,,"Ferreira, Marta Melo Coelho",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2018,, 9798383446881,,, English, English, <html><head><meta name='ValidationSchema' content='http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd'/><title></title></head><body>Análise de Dados de uma Empresa de Comércio Eletrónico de Moda para Promover Melhorias Estratégicas Nos Processos</body></html>,,,2018,PQDT -

Implementation of a PMO in a New Automation Business Unit in the Company Siemens,"The present work presents the research and implementation of a Project Management Office (PMO) in an automation laboratory in the industry sector within Monterrey, Mexico. The objective was to fully understand the concepts that surround the project management environment, the PMOs, as well as the challenges that must be overcome in order to successfully implement this PMO framework. The implementation of the PMO had the main purpose to solve the pain points that the laboratory was confronting in its daily business, such as difficulties to present information, prioritize projects, establish standardized processes, handover complications, poor portfolio management among others. We used the action research methodology for this implementation; providing the automation laboratory the best practices to handle extensive information derived from the complex projects they manage. With this new structure and tools, they are now applying standardized procedures, having efficient reports to management, better allocation of resources between the different projects on their portfolio and applying the right project management tools to deliver projects in the most effective and efficient way.",2675223224,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Rico, Lizeth Perez",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2018,, 9798819330296,,, English, English,,,,2018,PQDT - Global,2018,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/implementation-pmo-new-automation-business-unit/docview/2675223224/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Implementation+of+a+PMO+in+a+New+Automation+Business+Unit+in+the+Company+Siemens&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rico%2C+Lizeth+Perez&amp;isbn=9798819330296&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,present work present implementation project management office pmo automation laboratory industry sector within monterrey mexico objective fully understand concept surround project management environment pmos well challenge must overcome order successfully implement pmo framework implementation pmo main purpose solve pain point laboratory confronting daily business difficulty present information prioritize project establish standardized process handover complication poor portfolio management among others used action implementation providing automation laboratory best practice handle extensive information derived complex project manage new structure tool applying standardized procedure efficient report management better allocation resource different project portfolio applying right project management tool deliver project effective efficient way,"['present', 'work', 'presents', 'implementation', 'project', 'management', 'office', 'pmo', 'automation', 'laboratory', 'industry', 'sector', 'within', 'monterrey', 'mexico', 'objective', 'fully', 'understand', 'concepts', 'surround', 'project', 'management', 'environment', 'pmos', 'well', 'challenges', 'must', 'overcome', 'order', 'successfully', 'implement', 'pmo', 'framework', 'implementation', 'pmo', 'main', 'purpose', 'solve', 'pain', 'points', 'laboratory', 'confronting', 'daily', 'business', 'difficulties', 'present', 'information', 'prioritize', 'projects', 'establish', 'standardized', 'processes', 'handover', 'complications', 'poor', 'portfolio', 'management', 'among', 'others', 'used', 'action', 'implementation', 'providing', 'automation', 'laboratory', 'best', 'practices', 'handle', 'extensive', 'information', 'derived', 'complex', 'projects', 'manage', 'new', 'structure', 'tools', 'applying', 'standardized', 'procedures', 'efficient', 'reports', 'management', 'better', 'allocation', 'resources', 'different', 'projects', 'portfolio', 'applying', 'right', 'project', 'management', 'tools', 'deliver', 'projects', 'effective', 'efficient', 'way']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
APPLICATION OF LEAN SIX SIGMA TO REDUCE REPEATED HANDLING OF MATERIAL AT TOBYHANNA ARMY DEPOT,"The Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) focuses on the maintenance and support of command and control systems across the Department of Defense (DoD). Lean Six Sigma (LSS) uses the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) process to facilitate improvement in TYAD's fabrication of components by eliminating waste and streamlining manufacturing. The United States Military Academy's (USMA) LSS capstone team partnered with TYAD Directorate of Continuous Process Improvement on a Lean Six Sigma project to evaluate and reduce the repeated handling of raw materials and end items associated with the Machining Branch which contribute to high transportation and storage costs. The application of DMAIC process to a process with low production volume of a high variety of products demonstrated the applicability of the LSS process to reduce the number of repeated material runs for end items and raw materials by 50% in TYAD's Machine Shop, which resulted in an estimated annual cost savings of $71,500, while gaining insight on stakeholder interactions. USMA's LSS team's work allowed for an increase of utilization of LSS for Army applications.",2193095020,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Baily, Allan;Gibson, Bradley;MacFarlane, John-Mark;Hazelbaker, Cory;Richards, John;Lyle, Iris;Rawhouser, Brian",," Department of Defense , Department of the Army", Copyright American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM) 2018,,, Conference Proceedings,, 2018," Lean Six Sigma , Six Sigma , Fourth Industrial Revolution , Lean",,,, English, English,, 1-10, Huntsville,2018,Proceedings of the International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management.,2018,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/application-lean-six-sigma-reduce-repeated/docview/2193095020/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=APPLICATION+OF+LEAN+SIX+SIGMA+TO+REDUCE+REPEATED+HANDLING+OF+MATERIAL+AT+TOBYHANNA+ARMY+DEPOT&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Baily%2C+Allan%3BGibson%2C+Bradley%3BMacFarlane%2C+John-Mark%3BHazelbaker%2C+Cory%3BRichards%2C+John%3BLyle%2C+Iris%3BRawhouser%2C+Brian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",tobyhanna army depot tyad focus maintenance support command control system across lean six sigma lss us dmaic process facilitate improvement tyad fabrication component eliminating waste streamlining manufacturing united state academy usma lss capstone team partnered tyad directorate continuous process improvement lean six sigma project evaluate reduce repeated handling raw material end item associated machining branch contribute high transportation storage cost application dmaic process process low production volume high variety product demonstrated applicability lss process reduce number repeated material run end item raw material tyad machine shop resulted estimated annual cost saving gaining insight stakeholder interaction usma lss team work allowed increase utilization lss army application,"['tobyhanna', 'army', 'depot', 'tyad', 'focuses', 'maintenance', 'support', 'command', 'control', 'systems', 'across', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'lss', 'uses', 'dmaic', 'process', 'facilitate', 'improvement', 'tyad', 'fabrication', 'components', 'eliminating', 'waste', 'streamlining', 'manufacturing', 'united', 'states', 'academy', 'usma', 'lss', 'capstone', 'team', 'partnered', 'tyad', 'directorate', 'continuous', 'process', 'improvement', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'project', 'evaluate', 'reduce', 'repeated', 'handling', 'raw', 'materials', 'end', 'items', 'associated', 'machining', 'branch', 'contribute', 'high', 'transportation', 'storage', 'costs', 'application', 'dmaic', 'process', 'process', 'low', 'production', 'volume', 'high', 'variety', 'products', 'demonstrated', 'applicability', 'lss', 'process', 'reduce', 'number', 'repeated', 'material', 'runs', 'end', 'items', 'raw', 'materials', 'tyad', 'machine', 'shop', 'resulted', 'estimated', 'annual', 'cost', 'savings', 'gaining', 'insight', 'stakeholder', 'interactions', 'usma', 'lss', 'team', 'work', 'allowed', 'increase', 'utilization', 'lss', 'army', 'applications']",Conference Proceedings,2,Process Improvement
DESIGN OF THE MANUFACTURABILITY ASSESSMENT KNOWLEDGE-BASED EVAULATION TOOL,"The early stages of manufacturability design play a major role in the life cycle cost of a product, as such, there is a need for the application of systems level thinking and input from subject matter experts (SMEs) to be incorporated into early phase design decisions that will potentially impact life cycle costs. The literature shows that current tools available focus mostly on cost, with none focusing solely on early manufacturability and design. The Manufacturability Assessment Knowledge-based Evaluation (MAKE) is a tool created to aid SMEs in assessing the manufacturability and early design of a product. This type assessment is being created for the U.S. Army Engineering Research and Development Center's Engineered Resilient Systems program as an input variable. This paper will document the research and comparisons of other Design for Manufacturability tools. The outcome of this research provides the foundation for the need for a new tool and methodology. Additionally, this paper will outline the research performed to build the requirements for the MAKE Tool, discuss the lessons learned from case studies that led to improvement in the tool, and present an overview of the MAKE Tool. It will also discuss plans for integrating best practices from industry and concerns and recommendations from SMEs.

Development of a Conceptual Stage Product Design and Manufacturing Risk Mitigation Assessment,"The transition of products from conceptual design, through development, and ultimately to production and use is fraught with potential risk. The cumulative magnitude of associated risk depends largely on the maturity of the technical aspects of the product's design and the extent to which the required manufacturing processes are sufficiently ready for production. Products that incorporate proven technology with a demonstrated history of successful transition to production and sustainment are inherently less risky than products that integrate newly developed technology in a design which, in turn, may require development of yet unproven manufacturing processes. The United States Department of Defense (among other organizations) has established defined Technology Readiness Levels as well as defined Manufacturing Readiness Levels. The criteria contained therein effectively provides a baseline for the comprehensive information and activities necessary for transitioning a design through each of the successive stages of the product lifecycle. This research paper proposes a taxonomy based assessment of the ascertained risk associated with the baseline criteria at the early stages of a product's lifecycle that, unless mitigated, accumulates throughout the subsequent stages of the lifecycle. This phenomenon can result in cost overruns, functional degradation, and even failed product launches. The proffered methodology is intended to provide for an ""early warning"" system so that discrepancies in the criteria can be readily addressed at even the earliest stages, subsequently reducing or eliminating the resulting negative cost impacts of unmitigated risk.",2193094318,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Dalton, Larry G, PE;Wall, Emily S",," Department of Defense , Mississippi State University", Copyright American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM) 2018,,, Conference Proceedings,, 2018," Mitigation , Risk assessment , Product design , Product lifecycle , Conceptual design , Risk mitigation , Manufacturing",,,, English, English,, 1-10, Huntsville,2018,Proceedings of the International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management.,2018,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/development-conceptual-stage-product-design/docview/2193094318/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Development+of+a+Conceptual+Stage+Product+Design+and+Manufacturing+Risk+Mitigation+Assessment&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Dalton%2C+Larry+G%2C+PE%3BWall%2C+Emily+S&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",transition product conceptual design development ultimately production use fraught potential risk cumulative magnitude associated risk depends largely maturity technical aspect product design extent required manufacturing process sufficiently ready production product incorporate proven technology demonstrated history successful transition production sustainment inherently less risky product integrate newly developed technology design turn may require development yet unproven manufacturing process united state among organization established defined technology readiness level well defined manufacturing readiness level criterion contained therein effectively provides baseline comprehensive information activity necessary transitioning design successive stage product lifecycle proposes taxonomy based assessment ascertained risk associated baseline criterion early stage product lifecycle unless mitigated accumulates throughout subsequent stage lifecycle phenomenon cost overrun functional degradation even failed product launch proffered intended provide early warning system discrepancy criterion readily addressed even earliest stage subsequently reducing eliminating resulting negative cost impact unmitigated risk,"['transition', 'products', 'conceptual', 'design', 'development', 'ultimately', 'production', 'use', 'fraught', 'potential', 'risk', 'cumulative', 'magnitude', 'associated', 'risk', 'depends', 'largely', 'maturity', 'technical', 'aspects', 'product', 'design', 'extent', 'required', 'manufacturing', 'processes', 'sufficiently', 'ready', 'production', 'products', 'incorporate', 'proven', 'technology', 'demonstrated', 'history', 'successful', 'transition', 'production', 'sustainment', 'inherently', 'less', 'risky', 'products', 'integrate', 'newly', 'developed', 'technology', 'design', 'turn', 'may', 'require', 'development', 'yet', 'unproven', 'manufacturing', 'processes', 'united', 'states', 'among', 'organizations', 'established', 'defined', 'technology', 'readiness', 'levels', 'well', 'defined', 'manufacturing', 'readiness', 'levels', 'criteria', 'contained', 'therein', 'effectively', 'provides', 'baseline', 'comprehensive', 'information', 'activities', 'necessary', 'transitioning', 'design', 'successive', 'stages', 'product', 'lifecycle', 'proposes', 'taxonomy', 'based', 'assessment', 'ascertained', 'risk', 'associated', 'baseline', 'criteria', 'early', 'stages', 'product', 'lifecycle', 'unless', 'mitigated', 'accumulates', 'throughout', 'subsequent', 'stages', 'lifecycle', 'phenomenon', 'result', 'cost', 'overruns', 'functional', 'degradation', 'even', 'failed', 'product', 'launches', 'proffered', 'intended', 'provide', 'early', 'warning', 'system', 'discrepancies', 'criteria', 'readily', 'addressed', 'even', 'earliest', 'stages', 'subsequently', 'reducing', 'eliminating', 'resulting', 'negative', 'cost', 'impacts', 'unmitigated', 'risk']",Conference Proceedings,1,Process Improvement
The Role of Professional Development and Certification in Technology Worker Turnover: An Evaluation Study,"Companies invest resources on employee training with the hope that it adds value, sustainability, and profitability to the organization. There is risk in losing skilled workers when individual or organizational influences are undiagnosed, which makes talent management a critical part of a company’s strategy to increase an employee's organizational commitment. Currently, there is a lack of assessment data on turnover intention and organizational commitment of Technology Workers after receiving advanced training and this study examined the Knowledge, Motivation, and Organizational (KMO) influences affecting retention rates. A quantitative research study was conducted with 169 Technology Workers employed by a Department of Defense contracting company and used regression analysis to evaluate the interaction of 13 KMO based independent variables with an increased desire to turnover. The findings confirmed an assumption that completing professional development training or industry specific certification within the last year does influence a Technology Worker's desire to voluntarily turnover. Additionally, organizational commitment was heavily influenced by employee perceptions that they can pursue internal career advancement opportunities, the loyalty they have to the company for how it treats them, and the promises kept by an organization regarding pay raises, assignments, and promotions. Recommendations for improving practices and an implementation plan were provided to assist with organizational change efforts and addresses specific knowledge, motivation, and organizational influences that may be affecting retention efforts.",2182812164,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Puckett, Stephen P.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2018," (UMI)AAI11017087 , Social sciences", 9798662413320,,, English, English,,,,2018,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2018,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-professional-development-certification/docview/2182812164/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Role+of+Professional+Development+and+Certification+in+Technology+Worker+Turnover%3A+An+Evaluation+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Puckett%2C+Stephen+P.&amp;isbn=9798662413320&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,company invest resource employee training hope add value sustainability profitability organization risk losing skilled worker individual organizational influence undiagnosed make talent management critical part company strategy increase employee organizational commitment currently lack assessment turnover intention organizational commitment technology worker receiving advanced training examined knowledge motivation organizational kmo influence affecting retention rate quantitative conducted technology worker employed contracting company used regression evaluate interaction kmo based independent variable increased desire turnover finding confirmed assumption completing professional development training industry specific certification within last year influence technology worker desire voluntarily turnover additionally organizational commitment heavily influenced employee perception pursue internal career advancement opportunity loyalty company treat promise kept organization regarding pay raise assignment promotion recommendation improving practice implementation plan provided assist organizational change effort address specific knowledge motivation organizational influence may affecting retention effort,"['companies', 'invest', 'resources', 'employee', 'training', 'hope', 'adds', 'value', 'sustainability', 'profitability', 'organization', 'risk', 'losing', 'skilled', 'workers', 'individual', 'organizational', 'influences', 'undiagnosed', 'makes', 'talent', 'management', 'critical', 'part', 'company', 'strategy', 'increase', 'employee', 'organizational', 'commitment', 'currently', 'lack', 'assessment', 'data', 'turnover', 'intention', 'organizational', 'commitment', 'technology', 'workers', 'receiving', 'advanced', 'training', 'examined', 'knowledge', 'motivation', 'organizational', 'kmo', 'influences', 'affecting', 'retention', 'rates', 'quantitative', 'conducted', 'technology', 'workers', 'employed', 'contracting', 'company', 'used', 'regression', 'evaluate', 'interaction', 'kmo', 'based', 'independent', 'variables', 'increased', 'desire', 'turnover', 'findings', 'confirmed', 'assumption', 'completing', 'professional', 'development', 'training', 'industry', 'specific', 'certification', 'within', 'last', 'year', 'influence', 'technology', 'worker', 'desire', 'voluntarily', 'turnover', 'additionally', 'organizational', 'commitment', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'employee', 'perceptions', 'pursue', 'internal', 'career', 'advancement', 'opportunities', 'loyalty', 'company', 'treats', 'promises', 'kept', 'organization', 'regarding', 'pay', 'raises', 'assignments', 'promotions', 'recommendations', 'improving', 'practices', 'implementation', 'plan', 'provided', 'assist', 'organizational', 'change', 'efforts', 'addresses', 'specific', 'knowledge', 'motivation', 'organizational', 'influences', 'may', 'affecting', 'retention', 'efforts']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Continuous Learning
Strategies to Streamline the U.S. Army’s Acquisition Approval Process,"This qualitative single-case study explored strategies that senior U.S. Army Commanders could use to reduce the approval time for an acquisition category (ACAT) III need document in the Joint Capabilities Integrated Development System (JCIDS). Data came from historical documents and semistructured interviews of 30 ACAT III requirement writers and senior U.S. Army commanders with expertise in JCIDS. The conceptual framework was Goldratt’s theory of constraints. Miles, Huberman, and Saldana’s data analysis method was used to identify themes. Six themes emerged that yielded six possible strategies to reduce approval time: (a) define and implement an objective goal, (b) simplify the process and decrease redundancy by reducing or eliminating irrelevant levels of review, (c) determine the optimum number of reviews necessary for the desired outcome, (d) determine if the chief of staff of the Army should be the approving authority for an ACAT III need document, (e) determine the appropriate offices and individuals that should be consulted about the need document during the world wide review process, and (f) enhance training for JCIDS personnel participating in the need approval process. These findings are already contributing to positive organizational and social change because they have already been adopted by the U.S. Army as the basis for a significant effort to streamline the acquisition process, save U.S. taxpayer funding, and enhance the combat efficiency of the U.S. Army, thereby increasing the safety and security of the United States and its citizens.",2155171959,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Schlomer, Donald E;Campbell, Douglas G",, Department of the Army, Copyright Walden University Publishing 2018,,, Journal Article,, 2018," Acquisition , United States Army , Strategy , Army , Theory of constraints , JCIDS , ACAT , Constraints , Streamlining , Army",,,1.0, English, English,,, Minneapolis,2018,International Journal of Applied Management and Technology,2018,,17.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/strategies-streamline-u-s-army-acquisition/docview/2155171959/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Strategies+to+Streamline+the+U.S.+Army%26rsquo%3Bs+Acquisition+Approval+Process&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Applied+Management+and+Technology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schlomer%2C+Donald+E%3BCampbell%2C+Douglas+G&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Applied+Management+and+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",qualitative explored strategy senior army commander could use reduce approval time acquisition category acat iii need document joint capability integrated development system jcids came historical document semistructured interview acat iii requirement writer senior army commander expertise jcids conceptual framework goldratt theory constraint mile huberman saldana used identify theme six theme emerged yielded six possible strategy reduce approval time define implement objective goal simplify process decrease redundancy reducing eliminating irrelevant level review determine optimum number review necessary desired outcome determine chief staff army approving authority acat iii need document determine appropriate office individual consulted need document world wide review process enhance training jcids personnel participating need approval process finding already contributing positive organizational social change already adopted army basis significant effort streamline acquisition process save taxpayer funding enhance combat efficiency army thereby increasing safety security united state citizen,"['qualitative', 'explored', 'strategies', 'senior', 'army', 'commanders', 'could', 'use', 'reduce', 'approval', 'time', 'acquisition', 'category', 'acat', 'iii', 'need', 'document', 'joint', 'capabilities', 'integrated', 'development', 'system', 'jcids', 'data', 'came', 'historical', 'documents', 'semistructured', 'interviews', 'acat', 'iii', 'requirement', 'writers', 'senior', 'army', 'commanders', 'expertise', 'jcids', 'conceptual', 'framework', 'goldratt', 'theory', 'constraints', 'miles', 'huberman', 'saldana', 'data', 'used', 'identify', 'themes', 'six', 'themes', 'emerged', 'yielded', 'six', 'possible', 'strategies', 'reduce', 'approval', 'time', 'define', 'implement', 'objective', 'goal', 'simplify', 'process', 'decrease', 'redundancy', 'reducing', 'eliminating', 'irrelevant', 'levels', 'review', 'determine', 'optimum', 'number', 'reviews', 'necessary', 'desired', 'outcome', 'determine', 'chief', 'staff', 'army', 'approving', 'authority', 'acat', 'iii', 'need', 'document', 'determine', 'appropriate', 'offices', 'individuals', 'consulted', 'need', 'document', 'world', 'wide', 'review', 'process', 'enhance', 'training', 'jcids', 'personnel', 'participating', 'need', 'approval', 'process', 'findings', 'already', 'contributing', 'positive', 'organizational', 'social', 'change', 'already', 'adopted', 'army', 'basis', 'significant', 'effort', 'streamline', 'acquisition', 'process', 'save', 'taxpayer', 'funding', 'enhance', 'combat', 'efficiency', 'army', 'thereby', 'increasing', 'safety', 'security', 'united', 'states', 'citizens']",Journal Article,0,Process Improvement
Strategies for Improving Contractors' Defense Acquisition Cost Estimates,"In 2015, private sector Department of Defense (DoD) contractors experienced decreasing profit margins by approximately 8% and an increase in estimated costs of approximately 250%. The purpose of this multicase study was to explore strategies used by business leaders of private sector contractors for DoD capacity-building projects to accurately estimate program costs to improve profitability. The target population for this study was business leaders of DoD capacity-building program contractors with successful experience improving cost-estimation processes and strategies in Southeast Asia and the former Soviet Union. The conceptual framework for this study was business process quality management with a supporting framework of game theory. The data collection process comprised semistructured virtual interviews and a review of government and corporate documents. The data analysis process consisted of compiling data, disassembling data, reassembling data into groups and themes, and interpreting data, including methodological triangulation. Through data analysis, 5 themes were identified: enhanced customer relationships, increasing ability to innovate, improved project awareness, acquisition policy and political environments, and identification of labor rates and pricing. The implications for social change include the potential for DoD private industry business leaders to develop business strategies that result in improved profitability, creating opportunities to increase local economic impact and wage scales for local employees, higher levels of employment, and increased local technical knowledge.",2137610518,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Peters, Kenneth G.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2018," Social sciences , Cost estimate , Department of defense", 978-0-438-65358-0,,, English, English,,,,2018,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2018,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/strategies-improving-contractors-defense/docview/2137610518/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Strategies+for+Improving+Contractors%27+Defense+Acquisition+Cost+Estimates&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Peters%2C+Kenneth+G.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-65358-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,private sector contractor experienced decreasing profit margin approximately increase estimated cost approximately purpose multicase explore strategy used business leader private sector contractor project accurately estimate program cost improve profitability target population business leader program contractor successful experience improving process strategy southeast asia former soviet union conceptual framework business process quality management supporting framework game theory collection process comprised semistructured virtual interview review government corporate document process consisted compiling disassembling reassembling group theme interpreting including methodological triangulation theme identified enhanced customer relationship increasing ability innovate improved project awareness acquisition policy political environment identification labor rate pricing implication social change include potential private industry business leader develop business strategy improved profitability creating opportunity increase local economic impact wage scale local employee higher level employment increased local technical knowledge,"['private', 'sector', 'contractors', 'experienced', 'decreasing', 'profit', 'margins', 'approximately', 'increase', 'estimated', 'costs', 'approximately', 'purpose', 'multicase', 'explore', 'strategies', 'used', 'business', 'leaders', 'private', 'sector', 'contractors', 'projects', 'accurately', 'estimate', 'program', 'costs', 'improve', 'profitability', 'target', 'population', 'business', 'leaders', 'program', 'contractors', 'successful', 'experience', 'improving', 'processes', 'strategies', 'southeast', 'asia', 'former', 'soviet', 'union', 'conceptual', 'framework', 'business', 'process', 'quality', 'management', 'supporting', 'framework', 'game', 'theory', 'data', 'collection', 'process', 'comprised', 'semistructured', 'virtual', 'interviews', 'review', 'government', 'corporate', 'documents', 'data', 'process', 'consisted', 'compiling', 'data', 'disassembling', 'data', 'reassembling', 'data', 'groups', 'themes', 'interpreting', 'data', 'including', 'methodological', 'triangulation', 'data', 'themes', 'identified', 'enhanced', 'customer', 'relationships', 'increasing', 'ability', 'innovate', 'improved', 'project', 'awareness', 'acquisition', 'policy', 'political', 'environments', 'identification', 'labor', 'rates', 'pricing', 'implications', 'social', 'change', 'include', 'potential', 'private', 'industry', 'business', 'leaders', 'develop', 'business', 'strategies', 'result', 'improved', 'profitability', 'creating', 'opportunities', 'increase', 'local', 'economic', 'impact', 'wage', 'scales', 'local', 'employees', 'higher', 'levels', 'employment', 'increased', 'local', 'technical', 'knowledge']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
Servant Leadership Theory across Subcultures: A Comparative Study between Officer and Enlisted Leaders of the U.S. Air Force,"This research study investigated the theoretical servant leadership constructs of love, humility, altruism, trust, vision, empowerment, and service, developed by Patterson (2003), within two subcultures (officer-leaders and enlisted-leaders) of the greater culture of the U.S. Air Force. T -tests were used to investigate whether significant statistical differences were apparent between the two subcultures. Additionally, causal relationships between the seven constructs of Patterson’s (2003) servant leadership model were revealed using simple and multiple regression analysis to test these relationships. This study provided empirical cross subculture validation of Patterson’s (2003) theory in a military context. Overall, the evidence indicated both a both a high degree of statistical significance and a high degree of confidence that leaders of both subcultures (officer-leaders and enlisted-leaders) exhibited Patterson’s (2003) constructs of servant leadership. This finding added to the validity of the foundation previously developed by servant leadership experts and provided another platform for future investigation into servant leadership practices.",2115554804,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Ferris, Christopher B.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2018," Social sciences , Officer and enlisted leaders , Servant leadership theory , Subcultures , U.S. Air Force", 978-0-438-39434-6,,, English, English,,,,2018,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2018,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/servant-leadership-theory-across-subcultures/docview/2115554804/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Servant+Leadership+Theory+across+Subcultures%3A+A+Comparative+Study+between+Officer+and+Enlisted+Leaders+of+the+U.S.+Air+Force&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ferris%2C+Christopher+B.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-39434-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",investigated theoretical servant leadership construct love humility altruism trust vision empowerment service developed patterson within two subculture greater culture air force used investigate whether significant statistical difference apparent two subculture additionally causal relationship seven construct patterson servant leadership model revealed using simple multiple regression test relationship provided empirical cross subculture validation patterson theory context overall evidence indicated high degree statistical significance high degree confidence leader subculture exhibited patterson construct servant leadership finding added validity foundation previously developed servant leadership expert provided another platform future investigation servant leadership practice,"['investigated', 'theoretical', 'servant', 'leadership', 'constructs', 'love', 'humility', 'altruism', 'trust', 'vision', 'empowerment', 'service', 'developed', 'patterson', 'within', 'two', 'subcultures', 'greater', 'culture', 'air', 'force', 'used', 'investigate', 'whether', 'significant', 'statistical', 'differences', 'apparent', 'two', 'subcultures', 'additionally', 'causal', 'relationships', 'seven', 'constructs', 'patterson', 'servant', 'leadership', 'model', 'revealed', 'using', 'simple', 'multiple', 'regression', 'test', 'relationships', 'provided', 'empirical', 'cross', 'subculture', 'validation', 'patterson', 'theory', 'context', 'overall', 'evidence', 'indicated', 'high', 'degree', 'statistical', 'significance', 'high', 'degree', 'confidence', 'leaders', 'subcultures', 'exhibited', 'patterson', 'constructs', 'servant', 'leadership', 'finding', 'added', 'validity', 'foundation', 'previously', 'developed', 'servant', 'leadership', 'experts', 'provided', 'another', 'platform', 'future', 'investigation', 'servant', 'leadership', 'practices']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Assessing Ilities as an Indicator to Retiring DoD Systems,"The Department of Defense (DoD) faces a major challenge in determining when to retire aging systems or upgrade these legacy systems to continue to provide value to the end users. One would assume that the age of a system plays a major role in this decision; however, it turns out that this is not a significant factor. Thus, there must be attributes of legacy systems that makes the DoD more likely to extend the life of these systems. Additionally, if these attributes represent the value of legacy systems, they can be combined in a mathematical representation to determine the real system age for engineered systems. Grounded theory provides a method for determining what attributes extended systems such as the B-52, M-1A2, and A-10 share that may provide insights for DoD leadership to inform the retirement decision. This analysis identified flexibility, extensibility, versatility, interoperability, and robustness as significant factors to extending the life of a legacy system. However, the literature does not provide sufficient methods to quantify these ‘ilities, so this work adapts social network analysis tools to understand the DoD’s complex, network of systems and quantify these attributes. The research develops a network of 349 DoD systems to quantify the interoperability and versatility of these systems with social network analysis metrics, which provide a valid means of measuring these attributes. The main contribution of this work builds on the first two elements to develop a mathematical relationship for the real system age of an engineered system. This work builds on the literature from the biological systems, software aging, and medical fields to develop a theoretical real system age equation. The research applies this equation to a set of fourteen DoD system to determine if the equation provides an accurate indication of when the DoD should retire a system. From this analysis three heuristics emerge that provide valuable insights for DoD leadership on the health of these systems. This work provide a start point for research into the aging of engineered systems and suggests several areas for future work to expand the theoretical real system age of engineered systems.",2088122311,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Enos, James R.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2018," Applied sciences , Social sciences , Social network analysis , System aging , Systems engineering", 978-0-438-24126-8,,, English, English,,,,2018,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2018,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/assessing-ilities-as-indicator-retiring-dod/docview/2088122311/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Assessing+Ilities+as+an+Indicator+to+Retiring+DoD+Systems&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Enos%2C+James+R.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-24126-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",face major challenge determining retire aging system upgrade legacy system continue provide value end user one would assume age system play major role decision however turn significant factor thus must attribute legacy system make likely extend life system additionally attribute represent value legacy system combined mathematical representation determine real system age engineered system grounded theory provides determining attribute extended system share may provide insight leadership inform retirement decision identified flexibility extensibility versatility interoperability robustness significant factor extending life legacy system however literature provide sufficient method quantify ilities work adapts social network tool understand complex network system quantify attribute develops network system quantify interoperability versatility system social network metric provide valid mean measuring attribute main contribution work build first two element develop mathematical relationship real system age engineered system work build literature biological system software aging medical field develop theoretical real system age equation applies equation set fourteen system determine equation provides accurate indication retire system three heuristic emerge provide valuable insight leadership health system work provide start point aging engineered system suggests several area future work expand theoretical real system age engineered system,"['faces', 'major', 'challenge', 'determining', 'retire', 'aging', 'systems', 'upgrade', 'legacy', 'systems', 'continue', 'provide', 'value', 'end', 'users', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'age', 'system', 'plays', 'major', 'role', 'decision', 'however', 'turns', 'significant', 'factor', 'thus', 'must', 'attributes', 'legacy', 'systems', 'makes', 'likely', 'extend', 'life', 'systems', 'additionally', 'attributes', 'represent', 'value', 'legacy', 'systems', 'combined', 'mathematical', 'representation', 'determine', 'real', 'system', 'age', 'engineered', 'systems', 'grounded', 'theory', 'provides', 'determining', 'attributes', 'extended', 'systems', 'share', 'may', 'provide', 'insights', 'leadership', 'inform', 'retirement', 'decision', 'identified', 'flexibility', 'extensibility', 'versatility', 'interoperability', 'robustness', 'significant', 'factors', 'extending', 'life', 'legacy', 'system', 'however', 'literature', 'provide', 'sufficient', 'methods', 'quantify', 'ilities', 'work', 'adapts', 'social', 'network', 'tools', 'understand', 'complex', 'network', 'systems', 'quantify', 'attributes', 'develops', 'network', 'systems', 'quantify', 'interoperability', 'versatility', 'systems', 'social', 'network', 'metrics', 'provide', 'valid', 'means', 'measuring', 'attributes', 'main', 'contribution', 'work', 'builds', 'first', 'two', 'elements', 'develop', 'mathematical', 'relationship', 'real', 'system', 'age', 'engineered', 'system', 'work', 'builds', 'literature', 'biological', 'systems', 'software', 'aging', 'medical', 'fields', 'develop', 'theoretical', 'real', 'system', 'age', 'equation', 'applies', 'equation', 'set', 'fourteen', 'system', 'determine', 'equation', 'provides', 'accurate', 'indication', 'retire', 'system', 'three', 'heuristics', 'emerge', 'provide', 'valuable', 'insights', 'leadership', 'health', 'systems', 'work', 'provide', 'start', 'point', 'aging', 'engineered', 'systems', 'suggests', 'several', 'areas', 'future', 'work', 'expand', 'theoretical', 'real', 'system', 'age', 'engineered', 'systems']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Management and Leadership
A Qualitative Case Study in Professional Information Assurance Workforce Practices Demonstrated Through the Department of Defense,"The Department of Defense (DoD), like most very large organizations rightly have concerns over the functionality of their Cybersecurity employees and their ability to perform core duties in a professional manner. To validate this ability, the DoD imposed a mandatory certifications policy based upon positions within the organization. The DoD concept demonstrated one possible path in an effort to reduce cybersecurity incidents over the past 13 years, but the outcome has yet to quantitatively demonstrate an increase in workforce capabilities, a reduction in risk, or a return on investment for all of the mandatory training, certifications, recertifications, continuing professional education (CPE) hours, maintenance costs, temporary duty costs, or the loss of productivity during the process. This qualitative case study, explores eleven senior individuals to provide a single voice of workforce and first-line manager perceptions of the DoD mandate over a decade after the initial inception. The purpose of the study was not to generate theory based upon data and provide phenomenon, but to provide understanding to social environments within a large organization. The use of a single business case and open coding format allowed the research to gain granularity and lead to a better understanding in an original setting. The participants were all specifically chosen, because of their affiliation with the DoD as military members, DoD civilians, or DoD contractors. Each person was vetted to validate their legitimacy and availability for participation. The individuals answered a series questions in relationship to the three primary questions on validity of certifications, the risk rating of the organization, and the return on investment perceived by the individual. The workforce demonstrated a belief that gained knowledge through experience was greater than the other areas, but closely followed by certifications. None of the participants showed knowledge of a discernible change in the risk rating for the organization. No one provided specific insight into the return on investment for the DoD or individual organizations that make up the DoD. This study should be expanded to include a greater number and variety of participants and should be conducted by the DoD internally as a component of FISMA reporting.",2050026795,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Hodge, Timothy D.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Military Leaders' Perceived Importance of Emotional Intelligence (EI) Characteristics When Leading Organizational Change,"Purpose: The purpose of this descriptive, qualitative case study was to identify and describe exemplary military senior leaders’ perceived importance of emotional intelligence (EI) characteristics when leading organizational change. The study explicitly addressed the behavioral characteristics of U.S. Marine leaders associated with the EI framework for emotional competencies using Goleman, Boyatzis, and McKee’s (2002) four EI components: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management competencies. Methodology: A qualitative multiple-case study method was appropriate for this research due to its focus on analyzing the 12 exemplary senior leaders’ perceived importance of EI characteristics to lead change. The qualitative instrument included an in-person or telephonic interview of eight EI questions and the collection of award artifacts. These qualitative tools helped the researcher gain insight on the perceived importance of EI competencies for exemplary senior military leaders who were affiliated with the Installation Personnel Administration Center (IPAC) aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in California. The results of the data collection were analyzed using coding software to identify patterns and sort them into components. Findings: Participants identified EI components as essential when leading an organizational change episode. Although all components were deemed important, relationship management was determined to be the most valuable EI component when describing competencies while leading change. Conclusions: Senior U.S. Marine Corps leaders with high EI are perceived as effective change leaders who can positively lead an organizational change episode. Military senior leaders who foster strong relationship management skills with the competencies of influence, communication, collaboration and teamwork, conflict management, leadership, change catalyst, and building bonds are successful at leading organizational change. Recommendations: The researcher recommends that senior leaders tasked with an organizational change episode focus on all four of Goleman et al.’s (2002) EI components, but relationship management is the most critical to be an exemplary change episode leader. Military commanders and department leaders looking for positive organizational change should select senior leaders who foster relationships and have strong EI skills to lead the change

Reducing the Number of Nonparticipants in the U.S. Army Reserve,"The nonparticipation of U.S. Army Reserve soldiers throughout the Army Reserve Command is a critical problem for it results in millions of dollars in lost revenue. Retaining nonparticipant soldiers is a strategic, operational, and tactical priority for Army Reserve leadership. The purpose of this phenomenological qualitative study was to determine key themes concerning the potential root causes of nonparticipation in the Army Reserve. Using Herzberg’s motivation-hygiene theory, research was conducted to analyze the themes that contributed to nonparticipation, particularly lack of attendance at monthly battle assembly and extended combat training. Data were collected from telephone interviews that were conducted with 20 participants and then transcribed and analyzed using auto coding and query-based coding features. Ten themes emerged from analysis of responses to the 14 interview questions. A key result was that the participants believed that family, work, and school conflicts were barriers for soldiers not attending battle assembly or extended combat training. Further exploration of the participants’ experiences and perceptions resulted in the finding that communication was not effective between the leadership, staff, and first-line leaders and nonparticipant soldiers. Six participants agreed and 11 participants strongly agreed that new policy should be written to retain and recover nonparticipant soldiers. Study findings may enlighten the chain of command in the U.S. Army Reserve about the barriers leading to nonparticipation among soldiers and about how they may improve the participation rate. Such changes may foster more teamwork while contributing to productivity in the organization and safeguarding millions of dollars withheld from Army Reserve accounts.",2038441675,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Hannah, Renata W.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2018," Social sciences , Army Reserve , Corporate America , Employees , Productivity , Retention , Soldiers", 978-0-355-88368-8,,, English, English,,,,2018,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2018,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/reducing-number-nonparticipants-u-s-army-reserve/docview/2038441675/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reducing+the+Number+of+Nonparticipants+in+the+U.S.+Army+Reserve&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hannah%2C+Renata+W.&amp;isbn=978-0-355-88368-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",nonparticipation army reserve soldier throughout army reserve command critical problem result million dollar lost revenue retaining nonparticipant soldier strategic operational tactical priority army reserve leadership purpose phenomenological qualitative determine key theme concerning potential root cause nonparticipation army reserve using herzberg theory conducted analyze theme contributed nonparticipation particularly lack attendance monthly battle assembly extended combat training collected telephone interview conducted participant transcribed analyzed using auto coding coding feature ten theme emerged response interview question key participant believed family work school conflict barrier soldier attending battle assembly extended combat training exploration participant experience perception resulted finding communication effective leadership staff leader nonparticipant soldier six participant agreed participant strongly agreed new policy written retain recover nonparticipant soldier finding may enlighten chain command army reserve barrier leading nonparticipation among soldier may improve participation rate change may foster teamwork contributing productivity organization safeguarding million dollar withheld army reserve account,"['nonparticipation', 'army', 'reserve', 'soldiers', 'throughout', 'army', 'reserve', 'command', 'critical', 'problem', 'results', 'millions', 'dollars', 'lost', 'revenue', 'retaining', 'nonparticipant', 'soldiers', 'strategic', 'operational', 'tactical', 'priority', 'army', 'reserve', 'leadership', 'purpose', 'phenomenological', 'qualitative', 'determine', 'key', 'themes', 'concerning', 'potential', 'root', 'causes', 'nonparticipation', 'army', 'reserve', 'using', 'herzberg', 'theory', 'conducted', 'analyze', 'themes', 'contributed', 'nonparticipation', 'particularly', 'lack', 'attendance', 'monthly', 'battle', 'assembly', 'extended', 'combat', 'training', 'data', 'collected', 'telephone', 'interviews', 'conducted', 'participants', 'transcribed', 'analyzed', 'using', 'auto', 'coding', 'coding', 'features', 'ten', 'themes', 'emerged', 'responses', 'interview', 'questions', 'key', 'result', 'participants', 'believed', 'family', 'work', 'school', 'conflicts', 'barriers', 'soldiers', 'attending', 'battle', 'assembly', 'extended', 'combat', 'training', 'exploration', 'participants', 'experiences', 'perceptions', 'resulted', 'finding', 'communication', 'effective', 'leadership', 'staff', 'leaders', 'nonparticipant', 'soldiers', 'six', 'participants', 'agreed', 'participants', 'strongly', 'agreed', 'new', 'policy', 'written', 'retain', 'recover', 'nonparticipant', 'soldiers', 'findings', 'may', 'enlighten', 'chain', 'command', 'army', 'reserve', 'barriers', 'leading', 'nonparticipation', 'among', 'soldiers', 'may', 'improve', 'participation', 'rate', 'changes', 'may', 'foster', 'teamwork', 'contributing', 'productivity', 'organization', 'safeguarding', 'millions', 'dollars', 'withheld', 'army', 'reserve', 'accounts']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership

Factors that Influence how Sunni Muslims in Western Michigan Perceive Violence,"Decisionmakers in organizations like the Department of Defense and the State Department rely on accurate information to develop strategies to engage foreign populations. There is gap in understanding how perceptions are formed in religious adherents, specifically understanding how Muslims determine if violence is an acceptable or unacceptable behavior. Informed by Hobföll’s conservation of resources theory of stress, the purpose of this case study was to identify and understand the religious and secular factors that influenced a group of Sunni Muslims in Western Michigan to accept or reject violent behaviors. Research questions focused on how this population’s perception of violence was influenced by religion, various sources of information and threats of loss. Convenience sampling was used to identify the participants for this study. Data were collected from face-to-face interviews with 10 Sunni Muslims living in Western Michigan. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and the data were inductively coded and examined to identify trends in the information. While identity and religion were important to understanding how Muslims view the acceptability of violence, perceptions of the justice system's effectiveness also emerged as an important factor in understanding an individual’s tolerance for violent behaviors. The results of this study may contribute to positive social change by informing leaders who engage large Muslim populations about how perceptions of identity and justice system efficacy impact the acceptability of violent behaviors.",2029110716,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Busch, Joyce M.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2018," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Perception , Religion , Violence", 978-0-355-79838-8,,, English, English,,,,2018,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2018,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/factors-that-influence-how-sunni-muslims-western/docview/2029110716/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Factors+that+Influence+how+Sunni+Muslims+in+Western+Michigan+Perceive+Violence&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Busch%2C+Joyce+M.&amp;isbn=978-0-355-79838-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,decisionmakers organization like state rely accurate information develop strategy engage foreign population gap understanding perception formed religious adherent specifically understanding muslim determine violence acceptable unacceptable behavior informed hobföll conservation resource theory stress purpose case identify understand religious secular factor influenced group sunni muslim western michigan accept reject violent behavior question focused population perception violence influenced religion various source information threat loss convenience sampling used identify participant collected interview sunni muslim living western michigan interview recorded transcribed inductively coded examined identify trend information identity religion important understanding muslim view acceptability violence perception justice system effectiveness also emerged important factor understanding individual tolerance violent behavior result may contribute positive social change informing leader engage large muslim population perception identity justice system efficacy impact acceptability violent behavior,"['decisionmakers', 'organizations', 'like', 'state', 'rely', 'accurate', 'information', 'develop', 'strategies', 'engage', 'foreign', 'populations', 'gap', 'understanding', 'perceptions', 'formed', 'religious', 'adherents', 'specifically', 'understanding', 'muslims', 'determine', 'violence', 'acceptable', 'unacceptable', 'behavior', 'informed', 'hobföll', 'conservation', 'resources', 'theory', 'stress', 'purpose', 'case', 'identify', 'understand', 'religious', 'secular', 'factors', 'influenced', 'group', 'sunni', 'muslims', 'western', 'michigan', 'accept', 'reject', 'violent', 'behaviors', 'questions', 'focused', 'population', 'perception', 'violence', 'influenced', 'religion', 'various', 'sources', 'information', 'threats', 'loss', 'convenience', 'sampling', 'used', 'identify', 'participants', 'data', 'collected', 'interviews', 'sunni', 'muslims', 'living', 'western', 'michigan', 'interviews', 'recorded', 'transcribed', 'data', 'inductively', 'coded', 'examined', 'identify', 'trends', 'information', 'identity', 'religion', 'important', 'understanding', 'muslims', 'view', 'acceptability', 'violence', 'perceptions', 'justice', 'system', 'effectiveness', 'also', 'emerged', 'important', 'factor', 'understanding', 'individual', 'tolerance', 'violent', 'behaviors', 'results', 'may', 'contribute', 'positive', 'social', 'change', 'informing', 'leaders', 'engage', 'large', 'muslim', 'populations', 'perceptions', 'identity', 'justice', 'system', 'efficacy', 'impact', 'acceptability', 'violent', 'behaviors']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Using Multi Criteria Decision Analysis Decision Support Systems to Conduct Analysis of Alternatives for Department of Defense Acquisition Programs,"Despite being a mandated requirement, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found a lack of guidance across the Department of Defense for conducting analysis of alternatives which contributed to significant cost, schedule, and performance problems for Defense acquisition programs. In 2008 ninety-six major weapon system programs were reviewed and findings showed cost growths of $296 billion, average program delays of twenty-two months, and the delivery of fewer systems with reduced capabilities. Without specific guidance and criteria for how analysis of alternatives should be conducted the Department of Defense will continue to struggle to make informed trade-offs and start executable programs. This praxis presents a decision support system that enables decision makers to analyze cost, schedule, and performance ratings for multi criteria decision analysis problems. The decision support system provides interactive visualization tools that allow decision makers to execute sensitivity and uncertainty analyses, analyze the decision problem from multiple stakeholder-specific viewpoints, and synthesize results in a meaningful way. Although the primary motivation of this praxis is to fill the gap identified by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the decision support system presented in this praxis can be modified and applied across multiple domains.",1994222536,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Mahalak, David Matthew",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2018," Applied sciences , Social sciences , Analysis of alternatives , Decision analysis , Decision support systems , Defense acquisitions , Stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis , Systems engineering", 978-0-355-56812-7,,, English, English,,,,2018,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2018,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/using-multi-criteria-decision-analysis-support/docview/1994222536/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Using+Multi+Criteria+Decision+Analysis+Decision+Support+Systems+to+Conduct+Analysis+of+Alternatives+for+Department+of+Defense+Acquisition+Programs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mahalak%2C+David+Matthew&amp;isbn=978-0-355-56812-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",despite mandated requirement government accountability office found lack guidance across conducting alternative contributed significant cost schedule performance problem acquisition program major weapon system program reviewed finding showed cost growth billion average program delay month delivery fewer system reduced capability without specific guidance criterion alternative conducted continue struggle make informed start executable program praxis present decision support system enables decision maker analyze cost schedule performance rating multi criterion decision problem decision support system provides interactive visualization tool allow decision maker execute sensitivity uncertainty analysis analyze decision problem multiple viewpoint synthesize result meaningful way although primary motivation praxis fill gap identified government accountability office decision support system presented praxis modified applied across multiple domain,"['despite', 'mandated', 'requirement', 'government', 'accountability', 'office', 'found', 'lack', 'guidance', 'across', 'conducting', 'alternatives', 'contributed', 'significant', 'cost', 'schedule', 'performance', 'problems', 'acquisition', 'programs', 'major', 'weapon', 'system', 'programs', 'reviewed', 'findings', 'showed', 'cost', 'growths', 'billion', 'average', 'program', 'delays', 'months', 'delivery', 'fewer', 'systems', 'reduced', 'capabilities', 'without', 'specific', 'guidance', 'criteria', 'alternatives', 'conducted', 'continue', 'struggle', 'make', 'informed', 'start', 'executable', 'programs', 'praxis', 'presents', 'decision', 'support', 'system', 'enables', 'decision', 'makers', 'analyze', 'cost', 'schedule', 'performance', 'ratings', 'multi', 'criteria', 'decision', 'problems', 'decision', 'support', 'system', 'provides', 'interactive', 'visualization', 'tools', 'allow', 'decision', 'makers', 'execute', 'sensitivity', 'uncertainty', 'analyses', 'analyze', 'decision', 'problem', 'multiple', 'viewpoints', 'synthesize', 'results', 'meaningful', 'way', 'although', 'primary', 'motivation', 'praxis', 'fill', 'gap', 'identified', 'government', 'accountability', 'office', 'decision', 'support', 'system', 'presented', 'praxis', 'modified', 'applied', 'across', 'multiple', 'domains']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Management and Leadership

The DSCA Corps: Bridging the Gap between the Profession of Arms and Domestic Operations,"The system that facilitates Department of Defense (DOD) support of civil authorities during homeland security emergencies requires that local, state, and federal civilian resources be exhausted or in danger of exhaustion before DOD support can be provided. This system and its authorities are outlined in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), enacted into federal law in 1988 as an amendment to the existing Disaster Relief Act of 1974. Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) is the method by which DOD provides federal military support to civilian authorities during homeland emergencies. Joint Publication 3-28, which governs DSCA within the DOD, states, “DOD resources are provided only when response or recovery requirements are beyond the capabilities of local, state, and federal civil authorities, and when they are requested by a federal agency with lead responsibility and approved by SecDef.” (JP3-28 – DSCA, viii-ix) Historically, this has worked well most of the time. The Army has successfully provided support to civil authorities since the founding of the U.S. in 1776, but this support is not always as effective as it could be. The DOD has taken steps over the years to make the support more efficient, largely through improved policy and training. Since 9/11, the Army has engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which have stretched the Army and its soldiers to their limits. Training for DSCA missions was neglected for over a decade, while the Army struggled to maintain a combat-ready force. Consequently, an integration problem developed that became apparent in the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. National Guard forces in the affected states were largely deployed overseas when the hurricane struck. Active Army forces from all over the U.S., many of which had recently returned from combat rotations, were sent to provide DSCA. Their lack of training in this important mission set was never more obvious than when Lieutenant General Russel Honore, the Task Force Commander, went on television stating that the Army was in control of operations in New Orleans. Army forces attempted to conduct DSCA in the same manner they would combat operations against enemy forces. Conducting operations within the U.S. independent from direction by civil authorities is a violation of Federal Law and the laws in most states. Honore’s statements gave the impression that the military was in command of the hurricane response efforts, rather than providing resources to support the civilian emergency management command structure. In DSCA, unlike conventional operations, the military does not direct operations or control territory; it must only serve in a supporting role. The problem lies with the Army; it has both a lack of understanding of the civilian emergency response structures and processes and also a tendency to take charge of operations rather than deferring to civil authorities. In order to save lives and mitigate property damage, it is important for multiple agencies to rapidly integrate and cooperate to respond to disasters. The Army needs to find a way to improve its ability to integrate with civil authorities rapidly and effectively in order to make a positive impact on disaster response operations rather than detracting from them. This thesis will research the current conditions and how we can improve upon them. According to the National Response Framework (NRF), civil authorities must first exhaust all other options for resources at the local, state, and federal level before requesting resources from the DOD. The federal military resources must be formally requested through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). It is important to note that civil authorities do not request specific types of military units, but rather a certain type of capability; the military then decides which services and units have that capability to be used to provide the requested support. The Army has modeled its approach to DSCA after the NRF and the National Preparedness Doctrine (NPD), as outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD8). The NPD calls for an ‘all-of-nation approach’ to incident management, with the purpose of saving lives, alleviating suffering, and protecting property foremost in all aspects of a disaster response. Rather than a top-down approach, the NRF calls for a bottom up approach in responding to disasters. This means that civil authorities at the local level take the lead, with all higher levels providing support to the local Incident Commander (IC). The Army provides DSCA as a part of this tiered response, when local, state, and federal resources are exhausted. Major disasters require rapid and effective coordination and integration between military forces and civil authorities. In these situations, lives can be saved or lost based on the effectiveness of interagency coordination and the time elapsed from a request for resources to resources arriving at the incident. To illustrate this, two cases will be examined. First, the military response to Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 will be addressed in detail. Second, the military’s participation in the Cascadia Rising earthquake response exercise in June 2016 will be addressed. These cases are different in that one is a real-world response, while the other is an exercise. One is on the east coast, the other is on the west coast. One is a hurricane response, the other is an earthquake response. These cases are also similar in that they included active duty, reserve, and National Guard forces integrating with civil authorities across multiple states and jurisdictions. From examination of these cases, several shortfalls or gaps in the Army’s DSCA responses come to light. The most significant gap is a lack of education or knowledge of DSCA within the ranks of the Army. Many leaders receive training, but the majority of the soldiers on the ground responding to an incident have little knowledge of DSCA in any form. The next gap is ineffective liaison and integration between the Army and civilian agencies prior to and during the initial response phase of a major disaster. This includes building relationships with federal, state, and local agencies, integrating DSCA into civilian emergency response plans, and integrating Army forces into civilian structures rapidly during an emergency response. The last gap is a shortfall in integration of planning between military and civilian agencies prior to an event, including anticipation of needs following a catastrophic disaster. When the Army responds, the soldiers are un-trained to conduct their mission, know nothing about the civilian agencies with which they will work, and have not been integrated into any civilian emergency response plans. The job gets done – that’s what the Army does – but it could be so much more effective. There is one potential solution that could solve all of the problems listed; the creation of a new functional area within the Army with a sole focus on the Army’s DSCA mission. The Army currently has 28 branches and 15 functional areas within its force structure. There are currently no branches or functional areas with a DSCA or Homeland Security mission. In reality, the only certification a soldier can gain in DSCA is a voluntary Personnel Development Skill Identifier (PDSI), D7A – DSCA Specialist. This PDSI is gained by completing seven hours of Distance Learning (DL) training and attending a three-and-a-half-day course, which is taught by personnel from the National Guard Bureau (NGB), United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), and Army North (ARNORTH). The purpose of the DSCA Corps would be to bridge the gap between civil authorities and military forces before, during, and after a catastrophic disaster within the U.S. and its territories. The DSCA Corps fills this gap by providing force structure and a corps of subject matter experts who can develop and maintain relationships with civil authorities, facilitate the rapid deployment of Army units to support disaster response operations, and provide expert command and control of Army and joint forces during disaster response operations. The Army and DOD have made efforts since Hurricane Katrina to correct many shortfalls and gaps that have been identified in after action reports (AARs). Various entities throughout the Army, especially in the National Guard, have made efforts to improve integration and coordination between military and civilian agencies. Most of these efforts have been at the federal level between USNORTHCOM, ARNORTH, NGB, and partnering civilian agencies such as FEMA and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). These efforts have had limited success in correcting the functional shortfalls experienced during real-world disaster response situations. A major change is needed to correct these problems once and for all. The creation of a DSCA functional area within the Army would provide a set of units filled with DSCA specialists who can be the lead element in the Army for all DSCA missions. These units would be responsible for conducting liaison and relationship building with civilian agencies at every level of government, from federal to local. They would integrate into the planning processes for civilian agencies with the goal of anticipating their needs and facilitating the rapid deployment of Title 32 and Title 10 forces during a disaster. These soldiers would also serve as key facilitators of communication between civilian agencies and traditional Army formations, ensuring cohesive and integrated operations during any disaster response. The DSCA Corps concept needs to be implemented immediately within the Army. In spite of the budgetary restrictions the Army currently faces and the challenges presented by this change, our responsibility as soldiers and Americans is to do all we can to provide life-saving assistance to civilians during their time of greatest need. Failing to do everything in our power to ensure we can be readily and rapidly deployed where and when we are needed is counter to the Army values and our mission to defend the United States against all enemies, both foreign and domestic .

Increasing Partner-Nation Capacity Through Global Health Engagement,"Why the Department of Defense (DOD) and international military sector writ large engage in global health is well documented. How DOD conducts global health engagement (GHE) in a systematic way is not. While pundits representing the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, combatant commands, Service components, and other organizations codify DOD policy for GHE, individuals and units implementing this broad guidance from 2013 to today continue to do so in a patchwork manner.

Implementation of F.W. Lanchester’s combat model in a supply chain in duopoly: the case of Coca-Cola and Pepsi in Greece,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of applying some of the most widely known mathematical theories of war in the case of firms. In this research, Frederick William Lanchester’s combat models, that seemed to be particularly useful to the U.S. Army at the Pacific campaign against the Japanese fleet during World War II, were examined. These mathematical models were based on differential equations and their main purpose was to predict the outcome of battles. After the appropriate theoretical assumptions were set, the examined models were applied to the case of Coca-Cola™ and Pepsi™ supply chains in the Greek market. These models have been applied to these firms by other researchers too. The results of the implementations have led to the conclusion that the theoretical models are almost identical to the reality, which means that they are applicable in business under the right conditions.",1951546660,,,Scholarly Journals," Applied Economic Statistics and Operations Research Lab, Department of Business Administration, School of Business and Economics, Piraeus University of Applied Sciences (T.E.I. of Piraeus), Piraeus, Greece , Management Information Systems and New Technologies Lab, Department of Business Administration, School of Business and Economics, Piraeus University of Applied Sciences (T.E.I. of Piraeus), Piraeus, Greece","Chalikias, Miltiadis;Skordoulis, Michalis",,," Operational Research is a copyright of Springer, 2017.",10.1007/s12351-016-0226-0,, Journal Article,, Oct 2017," Operations research , Supply chains , Greece , Supply chain , Duopoly , Frederick William Lanchester , Mathematical theories of war , Differential equations , Supply chain , Duopoly , 90B06 , 93A30",,1109-2858,3.0, English, English,, 737-745, Heidelberg,Oct 2017,Operational Research,2017,,17.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/implementation-f-w-lanchester-s-combat-model/docview/1951546660/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Implementation+of+F.W.+Lanchester%26rsquo%3Bs+combat+model+in+a+supply+chain+in+duopoly%3A+the+case+of+Coca-Cola+and+Pepsi+in+Greece&amp;title=Operational+Research&amp;issn=11092858&amp;date=2017-10-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=737&amp;au=Chalikias%2C+Miltiadis%3BSkordoulis%2C+Michalis&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Operational+Research&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs12351-016-0226-0,"ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",purpose investigate possibility applying widely known mathematical theory war case firm frederick william lanchester combat model seemed particularly useful army pacific campaign japanese fleet world war examined mathematical model based differential equation main purpose predict outcome battle appropriate theoretical assumption set examined model applied case supply chain greek market model applied firm researcher result implementation led conclusion theoretical model almost identical reality mean applicable business right condition,"['purpose', 'investigate', 'possibility', 'applying', 'widely', 'known', 'mathematical', 'theories', 'war', 'case', 'firms', 'frederick', 'william', 'lanchester', 'combat', 'models', 'seemed', 'particularly', 'useful', 'army', 'pacific', 'campaign', 'japanese', 'fleet', 'world', 'war', 'examined', 'mathematical', 'models', 'based', 'differential', 'equations', 'main', 'purpose', 'predict', 'outcome', 'battles', 'appropriate', 'theoretical', 'assumptions', 'set', 'examined', 'models', 'applied', 'case', 'supply', 'chains', 'greek', 'market', 'models', 'applied', 'firms', 'researchers', 'results', 'implementations', 'led', 'conclusion', 'theoretical', 'models', 'almost', 'identical', 'reality', 'means', 'applicable', 'business', 'right', 'conditions']",Journal Article,1,Process Improvement
Push Logistics in a Communications Degraded/Communications Denied Environment,"""Since the end of the Cold War, the naval logistics force has progressively traded away combat effectiveness and survivability in the pursuit of peacetime efficiency and cost-saving solutions. Future processes and policies for subsistence provisioning assume traditional data transmission via Food Service Management (FSM) and STORES WEB will not be operational in communications degraded / denied environment (C2D2E). [...]Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) sponsored a continuous process improvement (CPI) event to validate a proof of concept for push logistics using food service replenishment as a prototype for other classes of supply. Co-chaired by U.S. Fleet Forces and U.S. Pacific Fleet, the CPI event included critical stakeholder representation from all type commands, NAVSUP, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, and the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center. Since the signing of the event's charter in May 2016, this dedicated group has accomplished the following: * Established a fleet-wide 14-day battle menu, derived from the existing 21-day Navy Standard Core Menu, that emphasizes shelf stable products, incorporates scratch cooking methodologies, and consolidates the total number of supporting subsistence line items to optimize the range and depth of Military Sealift Command (MSC) inventory. * Developed and piloted an adequate and scalable subsistence push pack able to sustain combat forces for a minimum of 180 days. * Identified and implemented modifications to doctrine, policy, statute, contracts, systems, and processes ensuring continuity of food service operations to outside the continental United States operating forces of the 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th Fleets via the Global Logistics Network when Phase 0 pathways for communication and traditional resupply are unavailable. * Incorporated best practices into fleet training venues and war games, and additionally, this group of subject matter experts identified solutions for a multitude of other pressing food service issues, to include: * Establishment of a primary stock number ordering system that will streamline the subsistence ordering process; drastically reducing culinary specialist workload afloat, resolve subsistence prime vendor (SPV) catalog issues due to Navy Information Application Product Suite replication failure, and address Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness compliance for Consolidated Afloat Requisitioning Guide Overseas (CARGO) food orders. * Enabling CONUS SPV support to forward locations; specifically aligning MSC information systems (ShipClip/ Combat Logistics Force Load Management System) with DLA's Deployable Distribution Center concept. * Establishment of an expanded CARGO deployment and distribution model enabled through system change requests addressing the FSM program's ability to accept suffixed requisition receipts and STORESWEB (DLA electronic SPV ordering point) ability to accept referred requisitions.",2283253289,,,Trade Journals," U.S. FLEET FORCES COMMAND , NAVAL SUPPLY SYSTEMS COMMAND","Gilmore, Ken, SC, USN;Wilson, Scott, SC, USN",," Military Sealift Command , Defense Logistics Agency , Department of the Army , Naval Supply Systems Command", Copyright Superintendent of Documents Jul/Aug 2017,,, General Information,, Jul/Aug 2017," Supply chain management , Military logistics , Logistics",,0360-716X,4.0, English, English,, 16, Washington,Jul/Aug 2017,Newsletter - United States.

"When the world calls for emergency services, who answers? A surgeon general’s perspective on running a high performance health services organization","This article records an interview by the author with Vice Admiral (retired) Matthew L. Nathan, 37th surgeon general of the United States (U.S.) Navy and chief of the U.S. Navy’s Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. The interview provides insights into developing a globally dispersed yet highly integrated health system managed and operated by an agile, mission-focused team of devoted professionals whose credo is to deliver “World-Class Care…Anytime, Anywhere.” We examine characteristics of Navy Medicine that align with evidence-based factors of high performance organizations (HPOs) to determine whether the system itself should be classified as an HPO.

Improving Readiness and Reducing Costs: An Analysis of Factors That Influence Site Selection for Army Outpatient Surgical Services,"The variable costs of providing surgical procedures for military beneficiaries are greater when care is rendered in the civilian purchased care network than when provided at a direct care military treatment facility (MTF). To reduce healthcare-related costs, retaining surgical services is a priority at MTFs across the U.S. Army Medical Command. This study is the first to identify factors significantly associated with outpatient surgical service site selection in the military health system (MHS). We analyzed 1,000,305 patient encounters in fiscal year 2014, of which 970,367 were direct care encounters and 29,938 were purchased care encounters. We used multiple binomial logistic regression to assess and compare the odds of site selection at a purchased care facility and an MTF. We found that an increase in provider administrative time (OR = 1.024, p &lt; .001) and an increase in case complexity (OR= 1.334, p &lt; .001) were associated with increased odds that an outpatient surgical service was provided in a purchased care setting. The increased odds that highly complex cases were seen in purchased care has the potential to affect the medical readiness of military providers and the efficacy of graduate medical education programs. Healthcare administrators can use the results of this study to develop and implement MTF level policies to enhance outpatient surgical service practices in the Army medical system. These efforts may reduce costs and increase military provider medical readiness.",1922872346,,,Scholarly Journals," Captain, U.S. Army, Fort Knox, Kentucky , Raabe College of Pharmacy, Ohio Northern University, Ada, Ohio , Army-Baylor University, Joint Base San Antonio, Texas , Lieutenant Colonel, Squadron Commander, 4thMedical Support Squadron, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, Goldsboro, North Carolina , senior data analyst, U.S. Army Medical Command Headquarters, Joint Base, San Antonio","Little, Katherine E;Martinez, Katie M;Forman, Jessica L;Richter, Jason P, PhD, FACHE;Wade, Michael L",,, Copyright Medknow Publications & Media Pvt.

ZERO to FULL MANPOWER in 8 HOURS,"In 2010 guidance, the deputy chief of staff (DCS) G-3/5/7 laid out an eight-step approach to developing, analyzing and presenting manpower staffing requirements through a cost benefit analysis (CBA). Workload factors and drivers are determined based on the organization's mission, input from functional subject matter experts, policy, business processes and workload trends. ""The PRSM - Program Management model has greatly improved the process of obtaining approval for manpower requirements,"" said Vincent Dahmen, a cost analyst at the PEO for Ammunition. ""Because the output of the model is accepted and respected by all of the stakeholders, the user doesn't have to start from scratch with new analysis every time there is a change to the organizational structure.""

RIDING the EXPERIENCE CURVE,"[...]a report on the F-35 Lighnting II, a fifth-generation fighter aircraft recognized for its advanced stealth capabilities, speed and agility, stated that more efficient manufacturing methods and processes would help drive down the per-unit cost of the fighter plane by $10 million by 2019. In a validation of the experience curve, Lockheed Martin stated that for the lowrate initial production (LRIP) 8 contract award, the average unit price of the airframes for the three F-35 variants was 3.6 percent lower than the LRIP 7 price. Plotting the actual F-35 cost data released by Lockheed Martin against the production run, a steep reduction in the unit cost is evident early in the production run but gradually levels off. [...]a trend indicates not only the immediate impact of economies of scale-another economic principle that states that doubling the input more than doubles the output-but also exhibits the tremendous learning potential in a nascent production facility. Both fixed and variable costs offer possibilities for lowering the cost structure with organizational learning. The Army can accelerate the cost savings by routinely deploying industry best practices-continuous improvement initiatives such as value analysis, value engineering and Lean Six Sigma-to continually reduce or eliminate waste and cut costs while improving product quality.

Embracing the Devil: An Analysis of the Formal Adoption of Red Teaming in the Security Planning for Major Events,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) takes the lead or significant supporting security role in many of the nation’s largest and most celebrated events across the country. These political, sporting, and cultural events present the nation’s adversaries with inviting targets due to the size, scope, and historical significance of the occasions. Often these events are attended by senior governmental leaders from the United States, as well as foreign countries. Group decision-making errors, assumptions in the planning process, and the failure to anticipate an ever-changing enemy or conditions can leave major events vulnerable to attack or serious disruption. Security planners must consider not only purposeful physical attacks, but also the whole spectrum of environmental, fire and life safety, and civil disobedience when designing countermeasures to risk. This thesis analyzes the planning process used to design and implement security procedures for major events throughout the country. Specifically, it examines security planning for events designated as a national special security event or those that receive a special event activity rating Level 1 from the DHS. This thesis focuses on the potential vulnerabilities and gaps in the planning process due to groupthink and other organizational decision-making pitfalls. The subcommittee process employed in these major events has proven effective in marshaling tremendous amounts of resources and ensuring that areas of responsibility are well-defined; however, it leaves open the potential for individual and organizational biases to impact planning. This project has explored the varieties of red team techniques available to major event security planners and asked the question: How would the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) benefit from formally adopting a red team component to major event security planning? This thesis then reviews which, if any, potential improvements can be made to the process with the formal adoption of a red team component. This paper derives data and evidence exclusively from publically available academic literature and after-action reports. It features a case study of the 2009 presidential inauguration, drawn from comparable publically released material. This project uses a blend of policy analysis and the case study method during the course of this project. The case study method relies heavily on the results of a small group of events that may be vulnerable to sampling bias and lead to results that may not be easily generalizable. The concepts and techniques of red teaming are being taught and increasingly used and accepted throughout the United States within the Department of Defense and the intelligence and law enforcement communities. The potential benefits and drawbacks of simulations, vulnerability probes, and analytical techniques have been explored in this project. While not all red team techniques are ideally suited for use in major event security design, the expanded use of analytical analysis has the potential to challenge organizational thought and assumptions. These techniques, however, need to be completed within the subcommittee framework used in the design and execution of security for major events. Based on the findings on red team performance and execution pitfalls, this thesis has made two proposals to insert formally an analytical red team capability into the framework used in major event security planning. The proposals have the potential to place properly trained individuals into the framework at the appropriate time to make improvements into the planning process. These proposals, however, must navigate the minefield of potential execution errors outlined in this thesis. While the DHS may theoretically benefit from the formal adoption of analytical red team techniques, the execution limitations discussed in this thesis reduce the likelihood for ideal results. The DHS needs to consider these limitations before formally adopting a red team component into the framework for major event security planning.",2206253933,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Landry, Thomas",, Department of Homeland Security," © 2017 by the author(s).

Target Parameter Estimation in MIMO Radars,"Accurate target parameter estimation and localization with fine resolution is important in radar systems. In this thesis, target parameter estimation methods are proposed for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars. The two different categories of radars, monostatic and bistatic radars from signal processing perspective are addressed. The proposed algorithms are developed to reduce the computational complexity while keeping low mean-square error. In the first part of the thesis, target parameter estimation methods in colocated MIMO radar are discussed. Conventional algorithms used for parameter estimation in colocated MIMO radars require the inversion of the covariance matrix of the received spatial samples. In these algorithms, the number of received snapshots should be at least equal to the size of the covariance matrix. For large size MIMO antenna arrays, the inversion of the covariance matrix becomes computationally very expensive. Compressive sensing (CS) algorithms which do not require the inversion of the complete covariance matrix can be used for parameter estimation with fewer number of received snapshots. In this work, it is shown that the spatial formulation is best suitable for large MIMO arrays when CS algorithms are used. A temporal formulation is proposed which fits the CS algorithms framework, especially for small size MIMO arrays. The simulation results show the advantage of CS algorithm utilizing low number of snapshots and better parameter estimation for both small and large number of antenna elements. In the second part of the thesis, we propose a reduced dimension and low complexity algorithm to estimate direction-of-arrival (DOA), direction-of-departure (DOD) and the Doppler shift of a moving target for a MIMO radar. We derive two cost functions based on two different objective functions. First, we solve each cost function with a low complexity FFT-based solution in three dimensions. We further carry out a derivation to reduce the three-dimensional search to two-dimensional search and solve it with a 2D-FFT. Another reduced dimension algorithm is derived using the generalized eigen value method which finds the estimate of unknown parameters in one dimension with less memory constraints. This way, we propose three algorithms based on the first cost function and another three algorithms based on the second. We show simulation results for a static target case and a moving target case. We compare the mean-square-error (MSE) performance and computational complexity of our proposed algorithms with existing algorithms as well. We show that our proposed algorithms have better MSE performance than existing algorithms and achieves the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for all unknown target parameters. The proposed algorithms exhibit lower computational complexity than the existing ones and also provide an estimate for the Doppler shift. Finally, in the last part of the thesis, we discuss the application of regularized least-squares in DOA estimation. If the covariance matrix of received signal is rank deficient, then we cannot find the inverse of the covariance matrix. Regularized least-squares algorithms deal with ill-conditioned matrices and rank deficient matrices. In this part of the thesis, we solve the DOA problem by using regularized least-squares algorithms when the covariance matrix of received signal is rank deficient. The simulation results show that it can recover the unknown target locations when the covariance matrix of received signal is rank deficient.",2865984096,, تقدير معلمة الهدف في رادارات

Defining Marketing-As-Practice and Identifying Marketing Tools Used by Practitioners in the Algarve,"Com a evolução exponencial do mercado e consequente aumento da concorrência direta e indireta, as empresas cada vez mais procuram utilizar abordagens e ferramentas de marketing inovadoras e adequadas às suas condições empresariais, procurando estar em consonância com a missão e objetivos definidos. As empresas desde sempre procuram vender os seus produtos/serviços a clientes, utilizando para tal métodos e abordagens comumente associada ao marketing. O que alterou nos anos mais recentes, como resultado de fatores económicos, tecnológicos e científicos, foi a forma como as empresas utilizam as practices e ferramentas de marketing. A adição de uma filosofia de gestão baseada numa pespetiva de marketing poderá influênciar a sobrevivência, prosperidade e crescimento da empresa. Dada a importância do marketing no contexto da competitividade dos negócios, tornase assim crucial analisar quais as practices e respetivas ferramentas utilizadas pelos practitioners de marketing no dia-a-dia das organizações, de forma a ser possível comparar com a concorrência, verificar tendências inovadoras e adequadas ao seu setor de atividade. De acordo com a revisão bibliográfica, foi encontrada uma lacuna nesta área de conhecimento: inexistência de uma abordagem específica capaz de aferir de forma simples e organizada quais as practices e respetivas ferramentas utilizadas pelas empresas. Foi no entanto possível identificar um modelo da área Estratégica, denominado Strategy-as-Practice, cujos atributos poderiam ser interessantes para a construção de uma nova abordagem. O modelo Strategy-as-Practice tem como fundamento base responder às seguintes questões: “Quem pratica?”; “O que fazem?”; “Como fazem?”; “O que utilizam?”; e “Que implicações tem no desenvolvimento da Estratégia?”. Este modelo surgiu com o mesmo objetivo para o qual a abordagem do Marketing-as-Practice foi criada, devido à insatisfação das empresas às abordagens convencionais de estratégia existentes. Foi também realizado uma análise dos vários conceitos, para que a abordagem do Marketing-as-Practice detivesse informação simples, atualizadas e inovadoras. O presente estudo propõe o desenvolvimento de uma nova abordagem para analisar o problema de investigação, aplicando-o às empresas da região do Algarve. Foi então vii definido como objetivo geral a determinação das practices e respetivas ferramentas de marketing utilizadas pelas empresas. Para que fosse possível atingir este objetivo geral estabelecido, foram criados alguns passos delineadores do projeto: examinar o modelo Strategy-as-Practice e os seus três eixos; desenvolver a abordagem do Marketing-as-Practice, baseado no modelo Strategy-as-Practice; e por fim aplicar os conceitos incluídos na abordagem Marketing-as-Practice determinando quais são os practices utilizadas pelas empresas da região do Algarve. Para justificar algumas decisões tomadas ao longo da dissertação, solicitou-se a opinião de dois gestores da região. Estes enfatizaram que as empresas da região do Algarve ainda são um pouco retógradas relativamente ao conceito geral do marketing e utilização das consequentes ferramentas, comparativamente com outras regiões de Portugal, sendo expectável que os resultados obtidos direcionassem para um grau de importância mais elevado respeitante a practices mais antigos, simples e de realização a curto-prazo. Os gestores ainda fizeram notar que muitas das empresas continuam a optar por recorrer a outsourcing, no que respeita ao marketing.

Clinical Decision Support: Knowledge Representation and Uncertainty Management,"Decision-making in clinical practice is faced with many challenges due to the inherent risks of being a health care professional. From medical error to undesired variations in clinical practice, the mitigation of these issues seems to be tightly connected to the adherence to Clinical Practice Guidelines as evidence-based recommendations The deployment of Clinical Practice Guidelines in computational systems for clinical decision support has the potential to positively impact health care. However, current approaches to Computer-Interpretable Guidelines evidence a set of issues that leave them wanting. These issues are related with the lack of expressiveness of their underlying models, the complexity of knowledge acquisition with their tools, the absence of support to the clinical decision making process, and the style of communication of Clinical Decision Support Systems implementing Computer-Interpretable Guidelines. Such issues pose as obstacles that prevent these systems from showing properties like modularity, flexibility, adaptability, and interactivity. All these properties reflect the concept of living guidelines . The purpose of this doctoral thesis is, thus, to provide a framework that enables the expression of these properties. The modularity property is conferred by the ontological definition of Computer-Interpretable Guidelines and the assistance in guideline acquisition provided by an editing tool, allowing for the management of multiple knowledge patterns that can be reused. Flexibility is provided by the representation primitives defined in the ontology, meaning that the model is adjustable to guidelines from different categories and specialities. On to adaptability, this property is conferred by mechanisms of Speculative Computation, which allow the Decision Support System to not only reason with incomplete information but to adapt to changes of state, such as suddenly knowing the missing information. The solution proposed for interactivity consists in embedding Computer-Interpretable Guideline advice directly into the daily life of health care professionals and provide a set of reminders and notifications that help them to keep track of their tasks and responsibilities. All these solutions make the CompGuide framework for the expression of Clinical Decision Support Systems based on Computer-Interpretable Guidelines.",2564122008,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Oliveira, Tiago José Martins",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Implementation of the Baldrige Criteria at USAG Eisenhower,"The U.S. Army has long endorsed the Baldrige Criteria as a management system for U.S. Army garrisons, but with mixed results. Leaders normally implement Baldrige by applying the categories with change factors such as strategy development, implementation, and assessment. However, these categories and factors alone are insufficient to ensure success. This qualitative case study describes how U.S. Army Garrison Eisenhower implemented the Baldrige Criteria as a management system since a garrison had not been studied. The conceptual framework facilitated data collection within the key factor areas and interconnectedness throughout the system. The data sources were interviews, documents, and observations, which were analyzed through coding. The findings and conclusions revealed that committed leaders must deploy the strategy by training, alignment, engagement, and improvement processes to achieve implementation results. Including Baldrige and the Garrison strategy in the professional development program can improve awareness. Strategy deployment can be enhanced by the development of action plans that are supported by operational planning boards. This alignment of operational and strategic priorities with the workforce influences daily operations and makes the strategy more holistic. Recurring process improvement forums can improve results. Workforce engagement in all aspects of implementation expands strategy buy-in, knowledge, and facilitates workforce empowerment to take the initiative in garrison priorities. Most importantly, leaders must be committed to managing the interconnectedness within the strategy and the cultural relationship with subordinate leaders and the workforce. Focusing on interconnectedness can increase the opportunity for success in implementing Baldrige as a management system.",2195599247,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Campbell, Randal L.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2017," Social sciences , Education , Case study , Interviews , Qualitative research , Army garrisons , Development program , Strategy deployment , Systems , Workforce engagement", 978-0-438-96250-7,,, English, English,,,,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/implementation-baldrige-criteria-at-usag/docview/2195599247/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Implementation+of+the+Baldrige+Criteria+at+USAG+Eisenhower&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Campbell%2C+Randal+L.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-96250-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",army long endorsed baldrige criterion management system army garrison mixed result leader normally implement baldrige applying category change factor strategy development implementation assessment however category factor alone insufficient ensure success qualitative case describes army garrison eisenhower implemented baldrige criterion management system since garrison studied conceptual framework facilitated collection within key factor area interconnectedness throughout system source interview document observation analyzed coding finding conclusion revealed committed leader must deploy strategy training alignment engagement improvement process achieve implementation result including baldrige garrison strategy professional development program improve awareness strategy deployment enhanced development action plan supported operational planning board alignment operational strategic priority workforce influence daily operation make strategy holistic recurring process improvement forum improve result workforce engagement aspect implementation expands strategy knowledge facilitates workforce empowerment take initiative garrison priority importantly leader must committed managing interconnectedness within strategy cultural relationship subordinate leader workforce focusing interconnectedness increase opportunity success implementing baldrige management system,"['army', 'long', 'endorsed', 'baldrige', 'criteria', 'management', 'system', 'army', 'garrisons', 'mixed', 'results', 'leaders', 'normally', 'implement', 'baldrige', 'applying', 'categories', 'change', 'factors', 'strategy', 'development', 'implementation', 'assessment', 'however', 'categories', 'factors', 'alone', 'insufficient', 'ensure', 'success', 'qualitative', 'case', 'describes', 'army', 'garrison', 'eisenhower', 'implemented', 'baldrige', 'criteria', 'management', 'system', 'since', 'garrison', 'studied', 'conceptual', 'framework', 'facilitated', 'data', 'collection', 'within', 'key', 'factor', 'areas', 'interconnectedness', 'throughout', 'system', 'data', 'sources', 'interviews', 'documents', 'observations', 'analyzed', 'coding', 'findings', 'conclusions', 'revealed', 'committed', 'leaders', 'must', 'deploy', 'strategy', 'training', 'alignment', 'engagement', 'improvement', 'processes', 'achieve', 'implementation', 'results', 'including', 'baldrige', 'garrison', 'strategy', 'professional', 'development', 'program', 'improve', 'awareness', 'strategy', 'deployment', 'enhanced', 'development', 'action', 'plans', 'supported', 'operational', 'planning', 'boards', 'alignment', 'operational', 'strategic', 'priorities', 'workforce', 'influences', 'daily', 'operations', 'makes', 'strategy', 'holistic', 'recurring', 'process', 'improvement', 'forums', 'improve', 'results', 'workforce', 'engagement', 'aspects', 'implementation', 'expands', 'strategy', 'knowledge', 'facilitates', 'workforce', 'empowerment', 'take', 'initiative', 'garrison', 'priorities', 'importantly', 'leaders', 'must', 'committed', 'managing', 'interconnectedness', 'within', 'strategy', 'cultural', 'relationship', 'subordinate', 'leaders', 'workforce', 'focusing', 'interconnectedness', 'increase', 'opportunity', 'success', 'implementing', 'baldrige', 'management', 'system']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Alternative Specimens in Forensic Toxicology: Analysis of Drugs of Abuse,"The main reason for this study’s development lies essentially in the fact that it gathers two areas of great interest and increasing progress in the forensic toxicology field: the postmortem alternative matrices and the new psychoactive substances. Firstly, it is possible to verify that alternative matrices have been playing an important role in the forensic toxicology field throughout the last decade. This relates with the fact they can be used as either a blood/urine complementary or in substitution when their collection is unavailable by several factors. In addition, Portugal and the rest of the world experienced a new emergent trend regarding the consumption of “new psychoactive substances”. This phenomenon brought about major public health injuries. The objective of the presented work was a contribution to the development of new analytical methods for the quantitative determinations of several new psychoactive substances in various biological matrices such as whole blood, plasma, vitreous humor and pericardial fluid. The substances on which we conducted our study were: salvinorin a (main active component of the plant salvia divinorum); some cathinones such as cathine, ephedrine, methcathinone, PMA, mephedrone, methedrone and some phenethylamines belonging to the D series, like the DOM and DOB and those that belong to the 2C-X series like 2C-H, 2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-4 and 2C-T-7. The mixed-mode was used (cathinones and phenethylamines) and reversed-phase (salvinorin a) adsorbents in the solid phase extraction for preparing samples of 250 μL of blood, plasma and pericardial fluid and 100 μL for vitreous humor. The obtained extracts were further analysed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in the SIM mode. To enable the detectability and the separation of the studied cathinones and phenethylamines a fast microwave derivatization procedure was previously applied, using the MBTFA reagent. Thus, in order to minimize the time required for classical techniques of derivatization in the analysis of drugs of abuse (over 30 minutes) a microwave procedure was optimized which lasts only 90 seconds. The method was applied to all substances with the exception of salvinorin a. Stable trifluoroacetyl derivatives were obtained with this optimized methodology. Once confidence in the interpretation of the analytical results was attained (as a prerequisite in forensic and clinical toxicology), it was necessary to ensure that the methods developed were suitable for its intended purposes. Thus, the proposed methodologies were fully validated, in all biological matrices studied according to internationally accepted recommendations. The methods were found to be selective for all tested compounds in all matrices studied. Linearity was achieved from 5-100 ng/mL for salvinorin a and from 5-600 ng/mL for cathinones and phenethylamines. The extraction efficiencies were between 80-100% for salvinorin a and 77-113% for cathinones and phenethylamines, in all the biological matrices studied. All results obtained for the parameters repeatability and intermediate precision presented CV&lt;20% and accuracy were within the acceptance interval of ±20% of the nominal values at all concentration levels. The methods presented limits of quantitation of 5 ng/mL for each compound, in the all biological matrices analysed. The developed methodologies have been applied to authentic samples from autopsies performed in the Clinical and Forensic Pathology Service and in the medico-legal Offices belonging to the delegation of the centre for the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic sciences, I.P. These procedures can be a useful tool in forensic toxicology laboratories. The major contributions are the complementation of the information possibly provided by each one of those fluids regarding drugs’ consumption and the prevention of situations where the blood is not available due to several factors of each individual case. In addition, it was also intended to implement the developed methodologies in routine analysis on the Laboratory of Chemistry and Forensic Toxicology of the centre branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences.",2034313021,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Margalho, Cláudia Isabel Reis",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual

Acquiring the Tools of Grand Strategy: The US Navy's LCS as a Case Study,"Grand strategy is about how states allocate resources and employ these resources to achieve desired political conditions. In examining the match between desired ends and available ways and means, an often-overlooked subject is how the specific tools of grand strategy are forged. One of these tools is the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) that started in 2000. LCS remains a controversial and often unpopular program with many stakeholders to this day. This study examines how the means of grand strategy, in this case a new ship class, are acquired. It also looks at how these means are employed (ways) to achieve the desired outcomes (ends) and the feedback loop between means, ways, and ends. The initial portion of the study examines how the U.S. Department of Defense and Department of the Navy formally acquire systems or “systems of systems.” The second portion of the study examines the design, construction, and fielding of the LCS class or the attainment of Initial Operational Capability (IOC). The final portion analyzes the design, construction, and introduction of the LCS into the fleet in terms of the three models used by Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow in Essence of Decision; the Rational Actor Model (RAM), Organizational Behavior, and Governmental Politics – Models I, II, and III respectively. The hypothesis is that individual personalities may have more influence than any of these models account for and that instances of individual impact may offer more nuanced insights into these models of state behavior. This study reveals that the process of evolutionary acquisition and spiral development caused increased risk in the time-line for achieving Final Operational Capacity (FOC) of LCS. It also provides insight into the reaction and adaption of a large organization to changes in its environment. This study does not however reveal strong evidence to support the hypothesis of individual personalities significantly influencing decision making or action taking compared to organizations in Models I-III. The details of individual participation and internal deliberations are obscured by security and proprietary rules which privileges models I and II in the analysis.",2026813194,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Murphy, Sean P.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2017," Social sciences , Acquisition , Littoral combat ship , Naval vessels , Procurement , Security , U.S. Navy", 978-0-355-77818-2,,, English, English,,,,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquiring-tools-grand-strategy-us-navys-lcs-as/docview/2026813194/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Acquiring+the+Tools+of+Grand+Strategy%3A+The+US+Navy%27s+LCS+as+a+Case+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Murphy%2C+Sean+P.&amp;isbn=978-0-355-77818-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,grand strategy state allocate resource employ resource achieve desired political condition examining match desired end available way mean subject specific tool grand strategy forged one tool littoral combat ship lcs major acquisition program mdap started lcs remains controversial often unpopular program many stakeholder day examines mean grand strategy case new ship class acquired also look mean employed way achieve desired outcome end feedback loop mean way end initial portion examines navy formally acquire system system second portion examines design construction fielding lcs class attainment initial operational capability ioc final portion analyzes design construction introduction lcs fleet term three model used graham allison philip zelikow essence decision rational actor model ram organizational behavior governmental politics model iii respectively hypothesis individual personality may influence model account instance individual impact may offer nuanced insight model state behavior reveals process evolutionary acquisition spiral development caused increased risk achieving final operational capacity foc lcs also provides insight reaction adaption large organization change environment however reveal strong evidence support hypothesis individual personality significantly influencing decision making action taking compared organization model detail individual participation internal deliberation obscured security proprietary rule privilege model,"['grand', 'strategy', 'states', 'allocate', 'resources', 'employ', 'resources', 'achieve', 'desired', 'political', 'conditions', 'examining', 'match', 'desired', 'ends', 'available', 'ways', 'means', 'subject', 'specific', 'tools', 'grand', 'strategy', 'forged', 'one', 'tools', 'littoral', 'combat', 'ship', 'lcs', 'major', 'acquisition', 'program', 'mdap', 'started', 'lcs', 'remains', 'controversial', 'often', 'unpopular', 'program', 'many', 'stakeholders', 'day', 'examines', 'means', 'grand', 'strategy', 'case', 'new', 'ship', 'class', 'acquired', 'also', 'looks', 'means', 'employed', 'ways', 'achieve', 'desired', 'outcomes', 'ends', 'feedback', 'loop', 'means', 'ways', 'ends', 'initial', 'portion', 'examines', 'navy', 'formally', 'acquire', 'systems', 'systems', 'second', 'portion', 'examines', 'design', 'construction', 'fielding', 'lcs', 'class', 'attainment', 'initial', 'operational', 'capability', 'ioc', 'final', 'portion', 'analyzes', 'design', 'construction', 'introduction', 'lcs', 'fleet', 'terms', 'three', 'models', 'used', 'graham', 'allison', 'philip', 'zelikow', 'essence', 'decision', 'rational', 'actor', 'model', 'ram', 'organizational', 'behavior', 'governmental', 'politics', 'models', 'iii', 'respectively', 'hypothesis', 'individual', 'personalities', 'may', 'influence', 'models', 'account', 'instances', 'individual', 'impact', 'may', 'offer', 'nuanced', 'insights', 'models', 'state', 'behavior', 'reveals', 'process', 'evolutionary', 'acquisition', 'spiral', 'development', 'caused', 'increased', 'risk', 'achieving', 'final', 'operational', 'capacity', 'foc', 'lcs', 'also', 'provides', 'insight', 'reaction', 'adaption', 'large', 'organization', 'changes', 'environment', 'however', 'reveal', 'strong', 'evidence', 'support', 'hypothesis', 'individual', 'personalities', 'significantly', 'influencing', 'decision', 'making', 'action', 'taking', 'compared', 'organizations', 'models', 'details', 'individual', 'participation', 'internal', 'deliberations', 'obscured', 'security', 'proprietary', 'rules', 'privileges', 'models']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
A Study of the Material Inspection Record and Quality Systems: A Case in the United States Department of the Navy,"Defective products and services are a part of every industry, sector, and organization. Minimization of those defects is essential for business success. The later those defects are found, the more they cost the business and consumer. This study investigated the impact having an accredited Quality Management System (QMS) had on the acceptance of delivered product. The study focused on the products delivered to the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) and Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) organizations. This study investigated the statistical significance between the means of the groups within size and number of accreditation. The dependent variables were Material Inspection Record (MIR), units received, and units rejected, or products delivered to the NAVSEA and NAVSUP organizations. The study used the PDREP Metric Dashboard data for fiscal year 2012, quarter 1 through fiscal year 2016, quarter 2, resulting in more than 8,000 records analyzed and interpreted using a one-way ANOVA and General Linear Model. The results of the analysis indicated there were no significant differences between size or accreditation of organizations, when compared to the number of rejected units and Material Inspection Report (MIR) acceptance or rejection. The analysis did suggest there is statistical significance when size and accreditation are compared to MIR acceptance or rejection (F-Value 3.01, P-Value 0.006). Additional analysis was conducted for within group comparisons and small organizations were identified as having a statistically disproportionate percentage of units rejected (76.61 percent), when compared to the percentage of units received (55.24 percent). Within small organizations, organizations with one accreditation had the highest ratio of units rejected compared to units received (2.00 to 1) as a percentage of units received within small organizations. Further research was recommended to explore other factors that would improve risk assessment and mitigation within the Department of Defense (DoD).",2013207524,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Brown, Larry W., Jr.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2017," Applied sciences , Social sciences , DCMA , DoD , Government , Quality management , Quality systems , Technology management", 978-0-355-62989-7,,, English, English,,,,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/study-material-inspection-record-quality-systems/docview/2013207524/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Study+of+the+Material+Inspection+Record+and+Quality+Systems%3A+A+Case+in+the+United+States+Department+of+the+Navy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brown%2C+Larry+W.%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=978-0-355-62989-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",defective product service part every industry sector organization minimization defect essential business success later defect found cost business consumer investigated impact accredited quality management system qms acceptance delivered product focused product delivered naval sea system command navsea naval supply system command navsup organization investigated statistical significance mean group within size number accreditation dependent variable material inspection record mir unit received unit rejected product delivered navsea navsup organization used pdrep metric dashboard fiscal year quarter fiscal year quarter resulting record analyzed interpreted using anova general linear model result indicated significant difference size accreditation organization compared number rejected unit material inspection report mir acceptance rejection suggest statistical significance size accreditation compared mir acceptance rejection additional conducted within group comparison small organization identified statistically disproportionate percentage unit rejected percent compared percentage unit received percent within small organization organization one accreditation highest ratio unit rejected compared unit received percentage unit received within small organization recommended explore factor would improve risk assessment mitigation within,"['defective', 'products', 'services', 'part', 'every', 'industry', 'sector', 'organization', 'minimization', 'defects', 'essential', 'business', 'success', 'later', 'defects', 'found', 'cost', 'business', 'consumer', 'investigated', 'impact', 'accredited', 'quality', 'management', 'system', 'qms', 'acceptance', 'delivered', 'product', 'focused', 'products', 'delivered', 'naval', 'sea', 'systems', 'command', 'navsea', 'naval', 'supply', 'systems', 'command', 'navsup', 'organizations', 'investigated', 'statistical', 'significance', 'means', 'groups', 'within', 'size', 'number', 'accreditation', 'dependent', 'variables', 'material', 'inspection', 'record', 'mir', 'units', 'received', 'units', 'rejected', 'products', 'delivered', 'navsea', 'navsup', 'organizations', 'used', 'pdrep', 'metric', 'dashboard', 'data', 'fiscal', 'year', 'quarter', 'fiscal', 'year', 'quarter', 'resulting', 'records', 'analyzed', 'interpreted', 'using', 'anova', 'general', 'linear', 'model', 'results', 'indicated', 'significant', 'differences', 'size', 'accreditation', 'organizations', 'compared', 'number', 'rejected', 'units', 'material', 'inspection', 'report', 'mir', 'acceptance', 'rejection', 'suggest', 'statistical', 'significance', 'size', 'accreditation', 'compared', 'mir', 'acceptance', 'rejection', 'additional', 'conducted', 'within', 'group', 'comparisons', 'small', 'organizations', 'identified', 'statistically', 'disproportionate', 'percentage', 'units', 'rejected', 'percent', 'compared', 'percentage', 'units', 'received', 'percent', 'within', 'small', 'organizations', 'organizations', 'one', 'accreditation', 'highest', 'ratio', 'units', 'rejected', 'compared', 'units', 'received', 'percentage', 'units', 'received', 'within', 'small', 'organizations', 'recommended', 'explore', 'factors', 'would', 'improve', 'risk', 'assessment', 'mitigation', 'within']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
IMPROVING THE GOVERNMENT PURCHASE CARD APPROVAL PROCESS AT THE U.S. MILITARY ACADEMY: A LEAN SIX SIGMA APPLICATION,"The U.S. Army adopted the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology for process improvement in 2004 and has been training LSS practitioners ever since. As part of this training, the Army requires green-belt level candidates to successfully complete a project using the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) process. This paper presents the results of a six-month effort that applied this methodology to government purchase card (GPC) approval process within the Dean's staff at the U.S. Military Academy. Although many associate the LSS process with manufacturing or supply chain processes, this application is an example of how the same methodology will result in the improvement of administrative processes. Through the DMAIC process, the team conducted detailed analysis of the available data, identified several areas for improvement, and implemented controls and procedures to get the process in control and reduce the number of defects in turn-in documentation. The results of the effort were profound and reduced the processing time by over 50% and improved the sigma quality level from 0.5 to 2.4. Additionally, the teams recommended changes to the GPC process are being adopted across the Academy to decrease processing time and improve quality associated with this administrative process. This paper provides an overview of the process and its application to the excessive time and effort required to approve simple purchases with a government credit card as a case study for a successful implementation of the Army's LSS process.",2010278390,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Klein, Micah J;Enos, James R",," Department of Defense , Department of the Army", Copyright American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM) 2017,,, Conference Proceedings,, 2017," Lean Six Sigma , Six Sigma , Lean manufacturing , Lean",,,, English, English,, 1-10, Huntsville,2017,Proceedings of the International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management.,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/improving-government-purchase-card-approval/docview/2010278390/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=IMPROVING+THE+GOVERNMENT+PURCHASE+CARD+APPROVAL+PROCESS+AT+THE+U.S.+MILITARY+ACADEMY%3A+A+LEAN+SIX+SIGMA+APPLICATION&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Klein%2C+Micah+J%3BEnos%2C+James+R&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",army adopted lean six sigma lss process improvement training lss practitioner ever since part training army requires level candidate successfully complete project using define measure analyze improve control dmaic process present result effort applied government purchase card gpc approval process within dean staff academy although many associate lss process manufacturing supply chain process application example improvement administrative process dmaic process team conducted detailed available identified several area improvement implemented control procedure get process control reduce number defect documentation result effort profound reduced processing time improved sigma quality level additionally team recommended change gpc process adopted across academy decrease processing time improve quality associated administrative process provides overview process application excessive time effort required approve simple purchase government credit card case successful implementation army lss process,"['army', 'adopted', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'lss', 'process', 'improvement', 'training', 'lss', 'practitioners', 'ever', 'since', 'part', 'training', 'army', 'requires', 'level', 'candidates', 'successfully', 'complete', 'project', 'using', 'define', 'measure', 'analyze', 'improve', 'control', 'dmaic', 'process', 'presents', 'results', 'effort', 'applied', 'government', 'purchase', 'card', 'gpc', 'approval', 'process', 'within', 'dean', 'staff', 'academy', 'although', 'many', 'associate', 'lss', 'process', 'manufacturing', 'supply', 'chain', 'processes', 'application', 'example', 'result', 'improvement', 'administrative', 'processes', 'dmaic', 'process', 'team', 'conducted', 'detailed', 'available', 'data', 'identified', 'several', 'areas', 'improvement', 'implemented', 'controls', 'procedures', 'get', 'process', 'control', 'reduce', 'number', 'defects', 'documentation', 'results', 'effort', 'profound', 'reduced', 'processing', 'time', 'improved', 'sigma', 'quality', 'level', 'additionally', 'teams', 'recommended', 'changes', 'gpc', 'process', 'adopted', 'across', 'academy', 'decrease', 'processing', 'time', 'improve', 'quality', 'associated', 'administrative', 'process', 'provides', 'overview', 'process', 'application', 'excessive', 'time', 'effort', 'required', 'approve', 'simple', 'purchases', 'government', 'credit', 'card', 'case', 'successful', 'implementation', 'army', 'lss', 'process']",Conference Proceedings,2,Process Improvement
"Enterprise Business System Effects on Workforce Staffing Levels: Examining Organizational Learning and Knowledge Transfer within the Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency","In 2014 the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) leadership at the Fleet Readiness Center South East, Jacksonville, FL (FRCSE) recognized inefficiencies within its workforce which contributed significantly to un-forecasted spending and revealed redundant job roles within the workforce structure. The purpose of this single case study research effort was to gain insight and understanding from archived data collected by DLA on how the implementation of the Enterprise Business System (EBS), an Enterprise Resource Planning tool (ERP), influences workforce staffing counts to improve business efficiencies and determine the appropriate workforce staffing level based on their missions and functions. The sample included government civilian employee participants within the job roles of customer support specialist, customer support technician, sustainment specialist, equipment specialist, resolution specialist, customer support manager, supply planner, demand planner, and material support technician. Data were gathered through face-to-face interviews. Surveys were emailed by the Defense Logistics Agency Office of Operations Research and Resource Analysis (DORRA) to approximately 250 potential participants. Seventy-eight participants completed the surveys and participated in the interviews. The resulting data provided a basis of comparison among the participants with regards to job functions they currently performed and those that they did not perform. The job functions were evaluated as percent values and time per units in relation to a normal day’s work. The results confirmed that several job functions required inordinate amounts of time to complete and influenced inefficiencies in other job functions. Results revealed that several job functions within each job role substantially contributed to inefficiencies and influenced workforce staffing levels. Evaluation of the findings lends itself to explain the connection between organizational learning and knowledge transfer when organizations implement ERPs. The results indicated that when organizations consider how they will implement the ERP, the type of learners within the organization, the optimal learning modality to utilize, and the amount of training resources needed in the planning phase greatly impacts the staffing levels required to perform efficient normal operations. The review of the literature and the results of this study aligned and were found to be congruent to the theoretical framework of this study. Recommendations as a result of this study suggests how ERP implementation changes workload functions that affects staffing by gaining organizational knowledge and knowledge transference capabilities, how leveraging organizational learning and the application of organizational knowledge mitigates the effects of ERP implementation on workload volumes, and suggestions and recommendations DLA leadership can provide other organizational leaders to overcome knowledge barriers, acquire organizational knowledge, and conduct continuous process improvements. Additionally, when organizations consider how they will implement the ERP, the type of learners within the organization, the optimal learning modality to utilize, and the amount of training resources needed in the planning phase greatly impacts the staffing levels required to perform efficient normal operations. This research was limited to one FRC however, the DoD as an institution is uniformly structured and future opportunities to conduct additional research exists. Repeating this study to examine other DLA FRCs across the DoD enterprise may verify if related conclusions can be attained.",2006656847,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Henderson, Jose Carlos",,, Database

Discovering Motivational Factors behind Employees Conducting Non-Malicious Information Security Policy Behavior: A Military Perspective,"Successful malicious cyber-attacks on organizational information systems were on the rise despite varying attempts to reduce the success for such attacks. These attacks were costing businesses millions of dollars to counteract and resolve. A significant contributor to malicious cyber-attacks on organization’s information systems was employees committing non-malicious ISP violations. Previous research indicated a lack of information security policy (ISP) training, discipline, and supervisory involvement as the motivation for non-malicious violative behavior. However, a focus on ISP training, discipline, and supervisory involvement has not corrected the issue. A literature review revealed a gap in understanding the physical effects of the employee’s working environment on individual attitude and intent to comply with ISP. The purpose of this quantitative correlational study was to examine the relationship between the intent of defaulters to comply with ISP and the state of security environment of organizations within the United States Air Force (USAF) and the attitude of defaulters with respect to perceived benefit and cost of compliance and cost of noncompliance. A sample from the approximate 9,600 active duty USAF personnel assigned to Ramstein Air Base was randomly selected to participate in an on-line survey. The questionnaire for the sample was based on the rational choice theory (RCT) and organizational culture theory (OCT). The key results included the rejection of null hypothesis 4 with a significant correlation between individual attitude and intent and perceived cost of noncompliance; null hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 were all accepted. The p value was .30, adjusted based on the sample size of 53 with α error probability of .05, power equal to .715, and critical r value of .2284. It is recommended the study be conducted again due to a reduced sample size based on the population size. Recommendations for future research included expanding this study to the civilian sector, increasing the sample size, and researching more portions of the combined theoretical framework. This study was not a Department of Defense (DoD) or Air Force sanctioned study and therefore was completed in compliance with DoD and Air Force regulations for such studies.",1990221332,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Van Hise, Julie A.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Establishing Best Practices in Logistics within Naval Aviation Enterprise: A Qualitative Case Study,"Department of Defense executives are continually looking for new toolsets in use within defense acquisition. Little information is present on the effectiveness and quality of these tools to compile best practices to relay across all services beneficial methods of procuring new weapon systems, or methods to cost effectively support deployed systems. U.S. Government budget constraints have demanded organizations establish better buying power of materials and resources to meet Secretary of Defense mandated levels of readiness. The purpose of research is to identify and evaluate effective practices within the Naval Aviation (NAVAIR) Program Offices. From this purpose, a common toolset of best practices associated with acquisition will be compiled. The research method is a qualitative case study to determine the effectiveness of toolsets currently being executed within the Naval Aviation Systems Command organizations that are enabling cost effective readiness in a fiscally constrained environment. The participants of the study are the Program executives and Level One Logistics executives that focus on supporting weapon systems in the most cost effective manner. Results of the study determined better collaboration both within NAVAIR and with external contractors needs improvement to better sustain and reduce the current readiness gap within naval aviation. In part a more robust defense acquisition workforce is necessary, as well as having better understanding of the tools used. A team effort in standardizing processes throughout organizations would help enable better contracting through learning from past mistakes and leveraging more timely data to make proactive decisions.",1989030834,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Walker, Nicholas",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2017," Social sciences , Establishing best practices , Logistics , Naval Aviation Enterprise", 978-0-355-39687-4,,, English, English,,,,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/establishing-best-practices-logistics-within/docview/1989030834/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Establishing+Best+Practices+in+Logistics+within+Naval+Aviation+Enterprise%3A+A+Qualitative+Case+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Walker%2C+Nicholas&amp;isbn=978-0-355-39687-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,executive continually looking new toolsets use within acquisition little information present effectiveness quality tool compile best practice relay across service beneficial method procuring new weapon system method cost effectively support deployed system government budget constraint demanded organization establish better buying power material resource meet secretary mandated level readiness purpose identify evaluate effective practice within naval aviation navair program office purpose common toolset best practice associated acquisition compiled qualitative case determine effectiveness toolsets currently executed within naval aviation system command organization enabling cost effective readiness fiscally constrained environment participant program executive level one logistics executive focus supporting weapon system cost effective manner result determined better collaboration within navair external contractor need improvement better sustain reduce current readiness gap within naval aviation part robust acquisition workforce necessary well better understanding tool used team effort standardizing process throughout organization would help enable better contracting learning past mistake leveraging timely make proactive decision,"['executives', 'continually', 'looking', 'new', 'toolsets', 'use', 'within', 'acquisition', 'little', 'information', 'present', 'effectiveness', 'quality', 'tools', 'compile', 'best', 'practices', 'relay', 'across', 'services', 'beneficial', 'methods', 'procuring', 'new', 'weapon', 'systems', 'methods', 'cost', 'effectively', 'support', 'deployed', 'systems', 'government', 'budget', 'constraints', 'demanded', 'organizations', 'establish', 'better', 'buying', 'power', 'materials', 'resources', 'meet', 'secretary', 'mandated', 'levels', 'readiness', 'purpose', 'identify', 'evaluate', 'effective', 'practices', 'within', 'naval', 'aviation', 'navair', 'program', 'offices', 'purpose', 'common', 'toolset', 'best', 'practices', 'associated', 'acquisition', 'compiled', 'qualitative', 'case', 'determine', 'effectiveness', 'toolsets', 'currently', 'executed', 'within', 'naval', 'aviation', 'systems', 'command', 'organizations', 'enabling', 'cost', 'effective', 'readiness', 'fiscally', 'constrained', 'environment', 'participants', 'program', 'executives', 'level', 'one', 'logistics', 'executives', 'focus', 'supporting', 'weapon', 'systems', 'cost', 'effective', 'manner', 'results', 'determined', 'better', 'collaboration', 'within', 'navair', 'external', 'contractors', 'needs', 'improvement', 'better', 'sustain', 'reduce', 'current', 'readiness', 'gap', 'within', 'naval', 'aviation', 'part', 'robust', 'acquisition', 'workforce', 'necessary', 'well', 'better', 'understanding', 'tools', 'used', 'team', 'effort', 'standardizing', 'processes', 'throughout', 'organizations', 'would', 'help', 'enable', 'better', 'contracting', 'learning', 'past', 'mistakes', 'leveraging', 'timely', 'data', 'make', 'proactive', 'decisions']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
Stay Off the Grass: Experiences of Mentors and Mentees in the U. S. Army,"During periods of conflict, the U.S. Army’s focus has historically shifted to tactical execution. Because of this shift, the more administrative details of the Army were placed on hold. The experiences of senior noncommissioned officers (NCOs) showed that mentoring had been one of those tools that was left behind. The specific problem to be addressed was that senior NCOs were not necessarily providing adequate mentorship to more junior NCOs. Additionally, there was a need to restructure the current, outdated Army mentorship program. The purpose of this phenomenological qualitative study was to discover whether both senior and junior NCOs lived mentoring experiences were deemed a valuable professional development tool and whether the current Army mentorship program was truly outdated and needed revamping to meet the needs of all junior and senior NCOs. The participants consisted of 3 senior NCOs who were selected based on their past senior leadership positions in the main stream Army as well as 3 junior NCOs. NVivo1111 was utilized as the research data base for this study. The data collection strategy for this phenomenological approach involved using three data collection instruments: (a) a pre-questionnaire to determine if potential participants met the inclusion criteria, (b) a simple questionnaire, the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ), and (c) an interview guide utilizing the critical incident technique (CIT). The results of this study indicate there was a definitive need for mentoring among both junior and senior NCOs. Furthermore, success (organizational/personal) was also important. The results of the current study support formalizing mentorship program in the U.S. Army. The participants have offered insight through their lived experiences that the lack of a proper mentor or mentorship program would not have provided the successful career path they have experienced. A formal mentorship program provides more competent, critically thinking NCOs and soldiers. Recommendations for future studies would include a much wider study conducted throughout the NCO education system of the U.S. Army. Based solely on the nature of the participants, data from the insights gathered demonstrated that there was a myriad of outcomes from adequate mentorship programs.",1988338465,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Ferreira, Christopher D.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Investigating the Perceived Influence of Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence Maturity on Organizational Performance: A Mixed Methods Study,"Over the past two decades organizations have made considerable investment in implementing data warehousing and business intelligence to improve business performance through facts-based decision-making. Although many of these organizations reap the rewards of their investments, others find that realizing the full value proposition is elusive. While the literature is rich with studies regarding data warehousing and business intelligence, much of the existing research focused on the initial experiences of adoption and implementation, and few yielded empirical data that reflected post-implementation conditions that lead to mature capabilities and improved business performance. Sited at the Defense Intelligence Agency where data warehousing and business intelligence capabilities have been in place for 10 years, this study investigated the perceived influences of data warehousing and business intelligence maturity on organizational performance through the perceptions of end users and senior leaders. This study employed mixed methods to examine the linkages between organizational support, information technology capabilities, practices, use, and organizational performance. Using survey responses from end users ( N = 29 respondents), the researcher employed linear regressions, and mediation analyses to test hypotheses and assess correlations among maturity variables and their effect on organizational performance. Conversely, the qualitative phase included semi-structured interviews with six senior leaders to understand their perceptions of existing data warehousing and business intelligence capabilities. The quantitative results and qualitative findings indicated significant correlations between the perceptions of organizational support, information technology capabilities, and use in predicting organizational performance. The discoveries resulting from this research represent an original contribution to the body of knowledge by providing empirical data to aid in advancing the scholarship and practice of the data warehousing and business intelligence maturity phenomenon.",1980692036,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Perkins, Charles Frederick",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

The Development of Organizational Training: Identifying Generational Differences and Perceptions in Computerized Learning Systems in Government Organizations,"Purpose: The purpose of this quantitative study was to determine the degree of effectiveness and preferences as it related to various computer-based training (CBT) and instructor-based training (IBT) types as perceived by baby boomer, Generation X, and millennial generational Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific) employees based in San Diego, California, as measured by the Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC) Extended Learning Institute Survey. Methodology: The study used a descriptive, causal-comparative research design. A survey was administered to collect demographic data and responses that described and determined the degree of difference and effectiveness for various CBT types as perceived by generational groups. Findings: Participants from all generations had varying attitudes toward training effectiveness and perceptions of training types; however, research suggests that baby boomers continue to adapt and embrace workplace technological changes based on attitudes toward their learning effectiveness and preferences. Generation Xers continue to embrace and reinvent workplace technological changes based on attitudes toward their learning effectiveness and preferences, and learning gaps between the younger, technology-savvy generation and older generations suggest attitudes and behaviors have closed in technologically advanced and diverse organizations. Conclusions: First, there are varying attitudes toward the degree of training effectiveness and perceptions of training types. Second, generational studies helped to uncover differences between the generational groups and the importance of understanding their training perceptions. Third, the concluding thought of this research is that implementing effective principles of transformational leadership is, foremost, the way to achieve success in training in a rapidly changing technological environment. Recommendations: This study considered insight into the perceptions of training effectiveness and preferences of government employees in a technologically advanced organization. The study also considered the role of the U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Education and Training Command, organizational development (OD) professionals, and curriculum development designers with the state of generational group perceptions of CBT effectiveness and the preferred type of CBT instruction. Results could help organizations engage generational employees by developing age-friendly blended teaching methods, such as slower presentations with increased discussion, longer practice sessions, and interactive computer programs to aid learning to close gaps in training and enhance technological proficiency.",1973131275,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Negron, Gregory P.",,, Database copyright

The Effect of the Selfless Leadership Program,"Emotional intelligence is understanding how the consequences of our actions have an effect on ourselves, and others. As an executive branch of the federal government the Department of Defense (DoD) is a complex world. Leaders within the DoD lead, and supervise personnel from many agencies and, if based in the overseas environment, many different cultures. Understanding and managing emotions allows leaders to display compassion when needed, motivate through communication, and build trusting relationship that allow collaboration across teams and cultures. Collaboration leads to innovation which in a fiscally constrained environment is critical. This Dissertation in Practice research was designed using a quantitative two-phased approach to understand what individual behavioral changes occurred in the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) Selfless Leadership Program (SLP) participants since completing the program. The aim of this study was to provide an evidence-based assessment of the effect of the program. Data was collected from the participants of the first five cohorts who completed the program. Analysis using ANOVA, and t-tests was performed to test the hypotheses formed in phases one and two. Statistically significant relationships between the SLP and global trait emotional intelligence and psychological empowerment were noted. The value of this research is in understanding the outcomes of a program designed to enhance the emotional intelligence of the participants and to measure the behavioral changes experienced by the participants who have completed the program.",1964958921,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Tapia, Lee",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2017," Social sciences , Education , Emotional intelligence , Engagement , Self-awareness , Trust", 978-0-355-23957-7,,, English, English,,,,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-selfless-leadership-program/docview/1964958921/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Effect+of+the+Selfless+Leadership+Program&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tapia%2C+Lee&amp;isbn=978-0-355-23957-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,emotional intelligence understanding consequence action effect others executive branch federal government complex world leader within lead supervise personnel many agency based overseas environment many different culture understanding managing emotion allows leader display compassion needed motivate communication build trusting relationship allow collaboration across team culture collaboration lead innovation fiscally constrained environment critical practice designed using quantitative understand individual behavioral change occurred landstuhl regional medical center lrmc selfless leadership program slp participant since completing program aim provide assessment effect program collected participant first five cohort completed program using anova performed test hypothesis formed phase one two statistically significant relationship slp global trait emotional intelligence psychological empowerment noted value understanding outcome program designed enhance emotional intelligence participant measure behavioral change experienced participant completed program,"['emotional', 'intelligence', 'understanding', 'consequences', 'actions', 'effect', 'others', 'executive', 'branch', 'federal', 'government', 'complex', 'world', 'leaders', 'within', 'lead', 'supervise', 'personnel', 'many', 'agencies', 'based', 'overseas', 'environment', 'many', 'different', 'cultures', 'understanding', 'managing', 'emotions', 'allows', 'leaders', 'display', 'compassion', 'needed', 'motivate', 'communication', 'build', 'trusting', 'relationship', 'allow', 'collaboration', 'across', 'teams', 'cultures', 'collaboration', 'leads', 'innovation', 'fiscally', 'constrained', 'environment', 'critical', 'dissertation', 'practice', 'designed', 'using', 'quantitative', 'understand', 'individual', 'behavioral', 'changes', 'occurred', 'landstuhl', 'regional', 'medical', 'center', 'lrmc', 'selfless', 'leadership', 'program', 'slp', 'participants', 'since', 'completing', 'program', 'aim', 'provide', 'assessment', 'effect', 'program', 'data', 'collected', 'participants', 'first', 'five', 'cohorts', 'completed', 'program', 'using', 'anova', 'performed', 'test', 'hypotheses', 'formed', 'phases', 'one', 'two', 'statistically', 'significant', 'relationships', 'slp', 'global', 'trait', 'emotional', 'intelligence', 'psychological', 'empowerment', 'noted', 'value', 'understanding', 'outcomes', 'program', 'designed', 'enhance', 'emotional', 'intelligence', 'participants', 'measure', 'behavioral', 'changes', 'experienced', 'participants', 'completed', 'program']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Improving Fleet Readiness Utilizing the AIRSpeed Continuous Improvement Strategy,"Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRC SW) Detachment North Island, San Diego, California serves as a maintenance depot for the General Electric T700-GE-401C turboshaft engines. These engines are used to power the H-60 helicopter for the U.S. Navy which comprise over 60% of Naval Aircraft. When engines arrive at the FRC, they are maintained and tested prior to being returned to a ship, squadron, or FRC SW's preservation pool. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of engines that fail final testing at the engine test cell. The failed tests result in additional maintenance with corresponding increases in to labor, re-work, additional fuel, and utilities consumption. Each failed test potentially delays the engine's return to the supply system which could cause engine shortages to deployed and state-side units. This paper presents a case study in which AIRSpeed, a Naval strategy for continuous improvement, is used to increase first past yield from 17.6% to 42%.

Model-Based Systems Engineering Application to Analyze the Ground Vehicle and Robotics Sustainment Support Strategy,"Model-Based Systems Engineering and Logistics Engineering are emerging disciplines that offer a synergy for integrating the proactive modeling of prototype R&amp;D acquisition and industrial base sustainment support into a framework that characterizes the most influential phases of the Department of Defense ground vehicle and robotics equipment life cycle. This research enhances situational awareness of upstream factors that drive the capability and capacity constraints to leveraging new technology for sustainment risk mitigation. These capability and capacity constraints include sub-optimal supply chain coordination and limited collaboration between government R&amp;D centers. This research also demonstrates how a new business model called the Defense Mobility Enterprise solves these problems, while offering an incubator for Model-Based Systems Engineering experimentation and continuous productivity improvement. Through the successful application of SysML, the modeling language of systems engineering, this research concludes with multi-model orchestration, using the momentum of commercial-off-the-shelf tools, providing a strategic lens with which to specify, analyze, design, and verify Department of Defense ground vehicle and robotics technology transition opportunities.",1920118230,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Patria, Garett Scott",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2017," Applied sciences , Logistics , Model-based systems engineering , Research and development , Supply chains , Sysml modeling language", 978-1-369-76760-5,,, English, English,,,,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/model-based-systems-engineering-application/docview/1920118230/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Model-Based+Systems+Engineering+Application+to+Analyze+the+Ground+Vehicle+and+Robotics+Sustainment+Support+Strategy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Patria%2C+Garett+Scott&amp;isbn=978-1-369-76760-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,system engineering logistics engineering emerging discipline offer synergy integrating proactive modeling prototype amp acquisition industrial base sustainment support framework characterizes influential phase ground vehicle robotics equipment life cycle enhances situational awareness upstream factor drive capability capacity constraint leveraging new technology sustainment risk mitigation capability capacity constraint include supply chain coordination limited collaboration government amp center also demonstrates new business model called mobility enterprise solves problem offering incubator system engineering experimentation continuous productivity improvement successful application sysml modeling language system engineering concludes orchestration using momentum tool providing strategic lens specify analyze design verify ground vehicle robotics technology transition opportunity,"['systems', 'engineering', 'logistics', 'engineering', 'emerging', 'disciplines', 'offer', 'synergy', 'integrating', 'proactive', 'modeling', 'prototype', 'amp', 'acquisition', 'industrial', 'base', 'sustainment', 'support', 'framework', 'characterizes', 'influential', 'phases', 'ground', 'vehicle', 'robotics', 'equipment', 'life', 'cycle', 'enhances', 'situational', 'awareness', 'upstream', 'factors', 'drive', 'capability', 'capacity', 'constraints', 'leveraging', 'new', 'technology', 'sustainment', 'risk', 'mitigation', 'capability', 'capacity', 'constraints', 'include', 'supply', 'chain', 'coordination', 'limited', 'collaboration', 'government', 'amp', 'centers', 'also', 'demonstrates', 'new', 'business', 'model', 'called', 'mobility', 'enterprise', 'solves', 'problems', 'offering', 'incubator', 'systems', 'engineering', 'experimentation', 'continuous', 'productivity', 'improvement', 'successful', 'application', 'sysml', 'modeling', 'language', 'systems', 'engineering', 'concludes', 'orchestration', 'using', 'momentum', 'tools', 'providing', 'strategic', 'lens', 'specify', 'analyze', 'design', 'verify', 'ground', 'vehicle', 'robotics', 'technology', 'transition', 'opportunities']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
Agile methodology for spacecraft ground software development: A cultural shift,"Conference Title: 2017 IEEE Aerospace Conference Conference Start Date: 2017, March 4 Conference End Date: 2017, March 11 Conference Location: Big Sky, MT, USA In the Space Exploration Sector (SES) at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) the development of Mission Operations Ground Software (GSW) to support NASA and Department of Defense spacecraft missions has traditionally followed the incremental build methodology. As part of our continuous process improvement effort, the Agile methodology is being introduced as an alternative approach to software development. To meet the needs of sponsor requirements and satisfy our quality management processes a tailoring of Agile is required. Development of ground software tools is currently in progress at JHU/APL to support NASA's Solar Probe Plus (SPP) Mission Operations. Tool development for spacecraft operation planning activities is paving the way for the cultural shift to agile methodology on candidate projects. The user community, the SPP Mission Operations team located at JHU/APL, supports the Agile Manifesto of heavy user involvement, the need for flexibility to evolve requirements and deliver frequent software releases to support readiness activities for the SPP launch in the summer of 2018. Agile was implemented following Scrum on two SPP GSW products, a spacecraft software simulator and the spacecraft activity planning tool. The paper will briefly introduce the heritage development process and compare this process with the evolving Agile approach. The discussion will include an assessment of how Agile methodology is being tailored using Scrum to adhere to our quality management processes (e.g., peer reviews, software assurance) to meet sponsor compliance requirements for current and future JHU/APL spacecraft missions. The current SPP GSW projects implementing Agile and the experiences and lessons learned to date will be highlighted throughout the paper.",1907725929,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Wortman, Kristin;Duncan, Brian;Melin, Eric",," Department of Defense , National Aeronautics & Space Administration--NASA"," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

A Deterministic and Random Propagation Study with the Design of an Open Path 320 GHz to 340 GHz Transmissometer,"This program was implemented by Lawrence J. Scally for a Ph.D. under the EECE department at the University of Colorado at Boulder with most funding provided by the U.S. Army. Professor Gasiewski is the advisor and guider for the entire program; he has a strong history decades ago in this type of program. This program is developing a more advanced than previous years transmissometer, called Terahertz Atmospheric and Ionospheric Propagation, Absorption and Scattering System (TAIPAS), on an open path between the University of Colorado EE building roof and the mesa on owned by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); NIST has invested money, location and support for the program. Besides designing and building the transmissometer, that has never be accomplished at this level, the system also analyzes the atmospheric propagation of frequencies by scanning between 320 GHz and 340 GHz, which includes the peak absorption frequency at 325.1529 GHz due to water absorption. The processing and characterization of the deterministic and random propagation characteristics of the atmosphere in the real world was significantly started; this will be executed with varies aerosols for decades on the permanently mounted system that is accessible 24/7 via a network over the CU Virtual Private Network (VPN).",1904915959,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Scally, Lawrence J.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2017," Pure sciences , Earth sciences , 340 GHz , Absorption , Electromagnetics , Propagation , Scattering , Transmissometer", 978-1-369-78540-1,,, English, English,,,,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/deterministic-random-propagation-study-with/docview/1904915959/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Deterministic+and+Random+Propagation+Study+with+the+Design+of+an+Open+Path+320+GHz+to+340+GHz+Transmissometer&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Scally%2C+Lawrence+J.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-78540-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,program implemented lawrence scally eece colorado boulder funding provided army professor gasiewski advisor guider entire program strong history decade ago type program program developing advanced previous year transmissometer called terahertz atmospheric ionospheric propagation absorption scattering system taipas open path colorado building roof mesa owned national institute standard technology nist nist invested money location support program besides designing building transmissometer never accomplished level system also analyzes atmospheric propagation frequency scanning ghz ghz includes peak absorption frequency ghz due water absorption processing characterization deterministic random propagation characteristic atmosphere real world significantly started executed varies aerosol decade permanently mounted system accessible via network virtual private network vpn,"['program', 'implemented', 'lawrence', 'scally', 'eece', 'university', 'colorado', 'boulder', 'funding', 'provided', 'army', 'professor', 'gasiewski', 'advisor', 'guider', 'entire', 'program', 'strong', 'history', 'decades', 'ago', 'type', 'program', 'program', 'developing', 'advanced', 'previous', 'years', 'transmissometer', 'called', 'terahertz', 'atmospheric', 'ionospheric', 'propagation', 'absorption', 'scattering', 'system', 'taipas', 'open', 'path', 'university', 'colorado', 'building', 'roof', 'mesa', 'owned', 'national', 'institute', 'standards', 'technology', 'nist', 'nist', 'invested', 'money', 'location', 'support', 'program', 'besides', 'designing', 'building', 'transmissometer', 'never', 'accomplished', 'level', 'system', 'also', 'analyzes', 'atmospheric', 'propagation', 'frequencies', 'scanning', 'ghz', 'ghz', 'includes', 'peak', 'absorption', 'frequency', 'ghz', 'due', 'water', 'absorption', 'processing', 'characterization', 'deterministic', 'random', 'propagation', 'characteristics', 'atmosphere', 'real', 'world', 'significantly', 'started', 'executed', 'varies', 'aerosols', 'decades', 'permanently', 'mounted', 'system', 'accessible', 'via', 'network', 'virtual', 'private', 'network', 'vpn']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
The Challenges of Commanding Modular Organizations: Based on a Modified Delphi Analysis of the U.S. Army,"To ensure competitive advantages and remain a sustainable fighting force within a global environment that is rapidly changing periodic checks are required to maintain a balanced and stable system. In this current research study a qualitative method, using a modified Delphi research design, was implemented to examine the challenges of commanding modular organizations through the ARFORGEN process within the U.S. Army while determining whether the underlying root cause of the challenge was leadership or process based. A study that probes both the ARFORGEN synchronization and modularity processes through a qualitative analysis could remedy the situation, create better understanding, and increase the long-term effects that influence strategic alignment of the organization. A panel of informed participants with experience as modular brigade and battalion commanders who used ARFORGEN participated in the modified Delphi study over the course of two rounds of questionnaires. The findings and conclusions of research questions indicated it is possible to determine the didactic nature between how a leader operates and the processes implemented to identify root causes for the challenges of commanding in a modular organizations. According to the informed participants’ interviewed in this study, the majority indicated that process was the overwhelming choice as the cause for integration challenges.",1899189666,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Cleotelis, Demetrious G.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2017," Social sciences , ARFORGEN , Leadership , Management , Modularity , Organizational dynamics , Process management", 978-1-369-74749-2,,, English, English,,,,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/challenges-commanding-modular-organizations-based/docview/1899189666/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Challenges+of+Commanding+Modular+Organizations%3A+Based+on+a+Modified+Delphi+Analysis+of+the+U.S.+Army&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cleotelis%2C+Demetrious+G.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-74749-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",ensure competitive advantage remain sustainable fighting force within global environment rapidly changing periodic check required maintain balanced stable system current qualitative using modified delphi design implemented examine challenge commanding modular organization arforgen process within army determining whether underlying root cause challenge leadership process based probe arforgen synchronization modularity process qualitative could remedy situation create better understanding increase effect influence strategic alignment organization panel informed participant experience modular brigade battalion commander used arforgen participated modified delphi course two round questionnaire finding conclusion question indicated possible determine didactic nature leader operates process implemented identify root cause challenge commanding modular organization according informed participant interviewed majority indicated process overwhelming choice cause integration challenge,"['ensure', 'competitive', 'advantages', 'remain', 'sustainable', 'fighting', 'force', 'within', 'global', 'environment', 'rapidly', 'changing', 'periodic', 'checks', 'required', 'maintain', 'balanced', 'stable', 'system', 'current', 'qualitative', 'using', 'modified', 'delphi', 'design', 'implemented', 'examine', 'challenges', 'commanding', 'modular', 'organizations', 'arforgen', 'process', 'within', 'army', 'determining', 'whether', 'underlying', 'root', 'cause', 'challenge', 'leadership', 'process', 'based', 'probes', 'arforgen', 'synchronization', 'modularity', 'processes', 'qualitative', 'could', 'remedy', 'situation', 'create', 'better', 'understanding', 'increase', 'effects', 'influence', 'strategic', 'alignment', 'organization', 'panel', 'informed', 'participants', 'experience', 'modular', 'brigade', 'battalion', 'commanders', 'used', 'arforgen', 'participated', 'modified', 'delphi', 'course', 'two', 'rounds', 'questionnaires', 'findings', 'conclusions', 'questions', 'indicated', 'possible', 'determine', 'didactic', 'nature', 'leader', 'operates', 'processes', 'implemented', 'identify', 'root', 'causes', 'challenges', 'commanding', 'modular', 'organizations', 'according', 'informed', 'participants', 'interviewed', 'majority', 'indicated', 'process', 'overwhelming', 'choice', 'cause', 'integration', 'challenges']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Strategies that Logistics Leaders use for Achieving Successful Process Improvement,"The successful implementation of process improvement (PI) could reduce operating costs of the Department of Defense, which could lessen the impact of budget reductions and the mounting costs of the expanding global mission requirements. Organizations fail to achieve the return on investment for PI and expected savings because of leaders’ inabilities and experiences in integrating critical success factors into PI to improve processes. The purpose of this single case study was to explore the strategies that logistics leaders use to implement PI in the military aviation industry. Six purposively selected group and squadron civilian leaders with over 10 years of experience in successful implementation of PI, working with the Air Force in the military aviation industry in Georgia, participated in the study. The theory of constraints was the conceptual framework for the study. Data collection was through semistructured interviews using open-ended questions, review of organizational documents, and archival records. Seven themes emerged from using a modified version of Miles and Huberman’s data analysis approach, including coding of transcribed interview data and grouping significant statements into larger units to form themes. Emerging themes included leadership, continuous PI, organizational culture, climate, strategic management, performance management, and resource.

Strategies for Exploring: ACAT III Requirement Approval Process,"The United States Congress mandated the Secretary of Defense develop a strategy to streamline the joint capabilities integrated development system (JCIDS). The purpose of this qualitative single case study was to explore strategies that senior U.S. Army Commanders might use to reduce the approval time for an acquisition category (ACAT) III need document in the JCIDS. Data came from historical documents and semistructured interviews of 30 ACAT III requirement writers and senior U.S. Army commanders with expertise in JCIDS. The conceptual framework was Goldratt’s theory of constraints. Miles, Huberman, and Saldana’s data analysis method was used to identify themes. Six themes emerged that yielded 6 possible strategies to reduce approval time: (a) define and implement an objective goal, (b) simplify the process and decrease redundancy by reducing or eliminating irrelevant levels of review, (c) determine the optimum number of reviews necessary for the desired outcome, (d) determine if the Chief of Staff of the Army should be the approving authority for an ACAT III need document, (e) determine the appropriate offices and individuals that should be consulted about the need document during the world wide review process, and (f) enhance training for JCIDS personnel participating in the ACAT III need approval process. The study findings may contribute to positive organizational and social change by potentially saving U.S. taxpayer funding and by enhancing the combat efficiency of the U.S. Army, thereby increasing the safety and security of the United States and its citizens.",1889082427,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Schlomer, Donald E.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2017," Social sciences , Bureacracy , Constraints , Leadership , Management , Procedures , Process", 978-1-369-70374-0,,, English, English,,,,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/strategies-exploring-acat-iii-requirement/docview/1889082427/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Strategies+for+Exploring%3A+ACAT+III+Requirement+Approval+Process&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schlomer%2C+Donald+E.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-70374-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Entrepreneurship Collection, ProQuest One Academic",united state congress mandated secretary develop strategy streamline joint capability integrated development system jcids purpose qualitative single case explore strategy senior army commander might use reduce approval time acquisition category acat iii need document jcids came historical document semistructured interview acat iii requirement writer senior army commander expertise jcids conceptual framework goldratt theory constraint mile huberman saldana used identify theme six theme emerged yielded possible strategy reduce approval time define implement objective goal simplify process decrease redundancy reducing eliminating irrelevant level review determine optimum number review necessary desired outcome determine chief staff army approving authority acat iii need document determine appropriate office individual consulted need document world wide review process enhance training jcids personnel participating acat iii need approval process finding may contribute positive organizational social change potentially saving taxpayer funding enhancing combat efficiency army thereby increasing safety security united state citizen,"['united', 'states', 'congress', 'mandated', 'secretary', 'develop', 'strategy', 'streamline', 'joint', 'capabilities', 'integrated', 'development', 'system', 'jcids', 'purpose', 'qualitative', 'single', 'case', 'explore', 'strategies', 'senior', 'army', 'commanders', 'might', 'use', 'reduce', 'approval', 'time', 'acquisition', 'category', 'acat', 'iii', 'need', 'document', 'jcids', 'data', 'came', 'historical', 'documents', 'semistructured', 'interviews', 'acat', 'iii', 'requirement', 'writers', 'senior', 'army', 'commanders', 'expertise', 'jcids', 'conceptual', 'framework', 'goldratt', 'theory', 'constraints', 'miles', 'huberman', 'saldana', 'data', 'used', 'identify', 'themes', 'six', 'themes', 'emerged', 'yielded', 'possible', 'strategies', 'reduce', 'approval', 'time', 'define', 'implement', 'objective', 'goal', 'simplify', 'process', 'decrease', 'redundancy', 'reducing', 'eliminating', 'irrelevant', 'levels', 'review', 'determine', 'optimum', 'number', 'reviews', 'necessary', 'desired', 'outcome', 'determine', 'chief', 'staff', 'army', 'approving', 'authority', 'acat', 'iii', 'need', 'document', 'determine', 'appropriate', 'offices', 'individuals', 'consulted', 'need', 'document', 'world', 'wide', 'review', 'process', 'enhance', 'training', 'jcids', 'personnel', 'participating', 'acat', 'iii', 'need', 'approval', 'process', 'findings', 'may', 'contribute', 'positive', 'organizational', 'social', 'change', 'potentially', 'saving', 'taxpayer', 'funding', 'enhancing', 'combat', 'efficiency', 'army', 'thereby', 'increasing', 'safety', 'security', 'united', 'states', 'citizens']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Process Improvement
Expeditionary economics: A qualitative case study of Army tactical leaders' economic development skills,"Abstract Since the early 1990s the U.S. Army has played a vital role in post-conflict economic development efforts yet Army tactical and operational leaders do not have the skills sets to support economic development tasks. To identify the required skill-sets and develop expertise around economic development projects in conflict and post-conflict zones, the Army needs to 1) identify those skills army tactical leaders need to acquire to attain such expertise and 2) identify pedagogical methods that can facilitate acquisition of such skills among army tactical leaders. The purpose of this exploratory qualitative single case study was to identify the critical skills required to facilitate economic development tasks performed by Army tactical leaders in conflict and in post conflict zones and to assess expert opinion concerning ideal pedagogical methods to promote acquisition of those skills by army tactical leaders. Ten tactical level officers were selected from the United States Central Command, in Tampa, Florida using convenience sampling to participate in individual in-depth interviews regarding their experiences with economic development during Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. Findings from the interviews were triangulated with content analysis results of 20 article articles written by Army tactical officers resulting in seven skill sets recommended for conducting economic development during post-conflict: (1) interpersonal skills (2) technical skills (3) external cultural awareness skills, (4) internal cultural awareness skills (5) mission awareness skills (6) analytical skills and (7) management skills. The study expands on the theory of Expeditionary Economics by identifying the skills necessary to conduct economic development during post conflict to help prepare U.S. Army tactical leaders to conduct economic development projects during future military operations.",1883823717,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Peterkin, Terrie L.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2017," Social sciences , Education , Economic development , Expeditionary economics , Military education , Military leadership training , Operation Enduring Freedom , Operation Iraqi Freedom", 978-1-369-66476-8,,, English, English,,,,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/expeditionary-economics-qualitative-case-study/docview/1883823717/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Expeditionary+economics%3A+A+qualitative+case+study+of+Army+tactical+leaders%27+economic+development+skills&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Peterkin%2C+Terrie+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-66476-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",abstract since early army played vital role economic development effort yet army tactical operational leader skill set support economic development task identify required develop expertise around economic development project conflict zone army need identify skill army tactical leader need acquire attain expertise identify pedagogical method facilitate acquisition skill among army tactical leader purpose exploratory qualitative single case identify critical skill required facilitate economic development task performed army tactical leader conflict post conflict zone assess expert opinion concerning ideal pedagogical method promote acquisition skill army tactical leader ten tactical level officer selected united state central command tampa florida using convenience sampling participate individual interview regarding experience economic development operation iraqi enduring freedom finding interview triangulated content result article article written army tactical officer resulting seven skill set recommended conducting economic development interpersonal skill technical skill external cultural awareness skill internal cultural awareness skill mission awareness skill analytical skill management skill expands theory expeditionary economics identifying skill necessary conduct economic development post conflict help prepare army tactical leader conduct economic development project future operation,"['abstract', 'since', 'early', 'army', 'played', 'vital', 'role', 'economic', 'development', 'efforts', 'yet', 'army', 'tactical', 'operational', 'leaders', 'skills', 'sets', 'support', 'economic', 'development', 'tasks', 'identify', 'required', 'develop', 'expertise', 'around', 'economic', 'development', 'projects', 'conflict', 'zones', 'army', 'needs', 'identify', 'skills', 'army', 'tactical', 'leaders', 'need', 'acquire', 'attain', 'expertise', 'identify', 'pedagogical', 'methods', 'facilitate', 'acquisition', 'skills', 'among', 'army', 'tactical', 'leaders', 'purpose', 'exploratory', 'qualitative', 'single', 'case', 'identify', 'critical', 'skills', 'required', 'facilitate', 'economic', 'development', 'tasks', 'performed', 'army', 'tactical', 'leaders', 'conflict', 'post', 'conflict', 'zones', 'assess', 'expert', 'opinion', 'concerning', 'ideal', 'pedagogical', 'methods', 'promote', 'acquisition', 'skills', 'army', 'tactical', 'leaders', 'ten', 'tactical', 'level', 'officers', 'selected', 'united', 'states', 'central', 'command', 'tampa', 'florida', 'using', 'convenience', 'sampling', 'participate', 'individual', 'interviews', 'regarding', 'experiences', 'economic', 'development', 'operations', 'iraqi', 'enduring', 'freedom', 'findings', 'interviews', 'triangulated', 'content', 'results', 'article', 'articles', 'written', 'army', 'tactical', 'officers', 'resulting', 'seven', 'skill', 'sets', 'recommended', 'conducting', 'economic', 'development', 'interpersonal', 'skills', 'technical', 'skills', 'external', 'cultural', 'awareness', 'skills', 'internal', 'cultural', 'awareness', 'skills', 'mission', 'awareness', 'skills', 'analytical', 'skills', 'management', 'skills', 'expands', 'theory', 'expeditionary', 'economics', 'identifying', 'skills', 'necessary', 'conduct', 'economic', 'development', 'post', 'conflict', 'help', 'prepare', 'army', 'tactical', 'leaders', 'conduct', 'economic', 'development', 'projects', 'future', 'operations']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
A Quantitative Study Examining How Training Enhances Policy Compliance,"For decades, the Department of Defense has been plagued by persistent cost, schedule, and performance problems in defense acquisition programs. Recent changes in Department of Defense acquisition policy were intended to improve efficiency and are demonstrating some improvement in terms of overall cost improvements, yet little is understood about whether training efforts related to the new policies are producing policy-compliant behavior on the job. Using Edgar Schein’s “Onion Model” of organizational change as the theoretical construct, the purpose of this study was to examine through an ex post facto, cross-sectional longitudinal study whether there is a significant relationship between learning achieved from Defense Acquisition University (DAU) training in acquisition policy and application of learned policy-compliant behavior, as represented by the variables learning achieved and applied training. Data were obtained from DAU that spanned 19 months and over 334,000 training events separated into 40 course-type subgroups. These data were analyzed through hierarchical regression analysis to test whether concepts learned in policy training predicted policy compliance. The findings confirmed that the independent variable of “learning achieved” is predictive of policy compliance ( p &lt;.001&lt;/italic&gt;). Additionally, course types employing transformative active learning and cross-functional team training had statistically significant relationships with the “learning achieved” variable. This study may support positive social change by informing policymakers of the importance of formal acquisition training using transformative training techniques in implementing needed culture change in the defense acquisition workforce, which should lead to better defense acquisition outcomes in support of national security.",1874565137,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Bensch, Therese C.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2017," Social sciences , Behavior change , Culture change , Defense acquisition , Organization change , Policy implementation , Training", 978-1-369-63376-4,,, English, English,,,,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/quantitative-study-examining-how-training/docview/1874565137/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Quantitative+Study+Examining+How+Training+Enhances+Policy+Compliance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bensch%2C+Therese+C.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-63376-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,decade plagued persistent cost schedule performance problem acquisition program recent change acquisition policy intended improve efficiency demonstrating improvement term overall cost improvement yet little understood whether training effort related new policy producing behavior job using edgar schein onion model organizational change theoretical construct purpose examine post facto longitudinal whether significant relationship learning achieved acquisition dau training acquisition policy application learned behavior represented variable learning achieved applied training obtained dau spanned month training event separated subgroup analyzed hierarchical regression test whether concept learned policy training predicted policy compliance finding confirmed independent variable learning achieved predictive policy compliance additionally course type employing transformative active learning team training statistically significant relationship learning achieved variable may support positive social change informing policymakers importance formal acquisition training using transformative training technique implementing needed culture change acquisition workforce lead better acquisition outcome support national security,"['decades', 'plagued', 'persistent', 'cost', 'schedule', 'performance', 'problems', 'acquisition', 'programs', 'recent', 'changes', 'acquisition', 'policy', 'intended', 'improve', 'efficiency', 'demonstrating', 'improvement', 'terms', 'overall', 'cost', 'improvements', 'yet', 'little', 'understood', 'whether', 'training', 'efforts', 'related', 'new', 'policies', 'producing', 'behavior', 'job', 'using', 'edgar', 'schein', 'onion', 'model', 'organizational', 'change', 'theoretical', 'construct', 'purpose', 'examine', 'post', 'facto', 'longitudinal', 'whether', 'significant', 'relationship', 'learning', 'achieved', 'acquisition', 'university', 'dau', 'training', 'acquisition', 'policy', 'application', 'learned', 'behavior', 'represented', 'variables', 'learning', 'achieved', 'applied', 'training', 'data', 'obtained', 'dau', 'spanned', 'months', 'training', 'events', 'separated', 'subgroups', 'data', 'analyzed', 'hierarchical', 'regression', 'test', 'whether', 'concepts', 'learned', 'policy', 'training', 'predicted', 'policy', 'compliance', 'findings', 'confirmed', 'independent', 'variable', 'learning', 'achieved', 'predictive', 'policy', 'compliance', 'additionally', 'course', 'types', 'employing', 'transformative', 'active', 'learning', 'team', 'training', 'statistically', 'significant', 'relationships', 'learning', 'achieved', 'variable', 'may', 'support', 'positive', 'social', 'change', 'informing', 'policymakers', 'importance', 'formal', 'acquisition', 'training', 'using', 'transformative', 'training', 'techniques', 'implementing', 'needed', 'culture', 'change', 'acquisition', 'workforce', 'lead', 'better', 'acquisition', 'outcomes', 'support', 'national', 'security']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Process Improvement
Hiring for Performance and Retention: Examining the Relationship between Cognitive Fit and Employee Turnover in the U.S. Navy,"Retaining top-performing talent is one of the most fundamental human resource challenges facing organizations today. Strong retention is critical to workforce quality and controlling human resource costs—especially in an entry-level hiring system like the U.S. Navy. The purpose of this quantitative study was to determine if cognitive fit predicts employee turnover by comparing U.S. Navy enlisted sailor Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test scores to the cognitive demands for their career fields in the Navy. It includes an analysis of this measurement of cognitive fit with retention data to ascertain if it predicts employee turnover. The mean value of cognitive fit for the Navy was negative, and although cognitive fit was statistically significant for voluntary and involuntary turnover in the full dataset, the effect sizes were very small. Further testing of 10%, 1%, and stratified random subsets of the data refuted the value of the significance of the findings in the full dataset, indicating that cognitive fit and interactions with gender and length of service are not important predictors of future employee turnover. This research implies that the Navy is not placing sailors in best fit jobs, and that objective measurements of cognitive fit are not enough to predict future employee turnover. Recommendations include changing the Navy’s recruitment process to allow time to match applicants to best fit jobs and utilizing other subjective measurements, such as an interest inventory, with cognitive fit in job placement. The results of this study benefit the U.S. Navy, and other military services and organizations by offering new ideas on how to measure cognitive fit and exploring ways to improve the hiring process, optimizing placement, utilization, and retention of personnel.",1868415333,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Squier, Renee J.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2017," Social sciences , Cognitive ability , Cognitive fit , Demands-abilities fit , Employee fit , Employee turnover", 978-1-369-48452-6,,, English, English,,,,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2017,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/hiring-performance-retention-examining/docview/1868415333/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hiring+for+Performance+and+Retention%3A+Examining+the+Relationship+between+Cognitive+Fit+and+Employee+Turnover+in+the+U.S.+Navy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Squier%2C+Renee+J.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-48452-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,retaining talent one fundamental human resource challenge facing organization today strong retention critical workforce quality controlling human resource hiring system like navy purpose quantitative determine cognitive fit predicts employee turnover comparing navy enlisted sailor armed service vocational aptitude battery test score cognitive demand career field navy includes measurement cognitive fit retention ascertain predicts employee turnover mean value cognitive fit navy negative although cognitive fit statistically significant voluntary involuntary turnover full dataset effect size small testing stratified random subset refuted value significance finding full dataset indicating cognitive fit interaction gender length service important predictor future employee turnover implies navy placing sailor best fit job objective measurement cognitive fit enough predict future employee turnover recommendation include changing navy recruitment process allow time match applicant best fit job utilizing subjective measurement interest inventory cognitive fit job placement result benefit navy service organization offering new idea measure cognitive fit exploring way improve hiring process optimizing placement utilization retention personnel,"['retaining', 'talent', 'one', 'fundamental', 'human', 'resource', 'challenges', 'facing', 'organizations', 'today', 'strong', 'retention', 'critical', 'workforce', 'quality', 'controlling', 'human', 'resource', 'hiring', 'system', 'like', 'navy', 'purpose', 'quantitative', 'determine', 'cognitive', 'fit', 'predicts', 'employee', 'turnover', 'comparing', 'navy', 'enlisted', 'sailor', 'armed', 'services', 'vocational', 'aptitude', 'battery', 'test', 'scores', 'cognitive', 'demands', 'career', 'fields', 'navy', 'includes', 'measurement', 'cognitive', 'fit', 'retention', 'data', 'ascertain', 'predicts', 'employee', 'turnover', 'mean', 'value', 'cognitive', 'fit', 'navy', 'negative', 'although', 'cognitive', 'fit', 'statistically', 'significant', 'voluntary', 'involuntary', 'turnover', 'full', 'dataset', 'effect', 'sizes', 'small', 'testing', 'stratified', 'random', 'subsets', 'data', 'refuted', 'value', 'significance', 'findings', 'full', 'dataset', 'indicating', 'cognitive', 'fit', 'interactions', 'gender', 'length', 'service', 'important', 'predictors', 'future', 'employee', 'turnover', 'implies', 'navy', 'placing', 'sailors', 'best', 'fit', 'jobs', 'objective', 'measurements', 'cognitive', 'fit', 'enough', 'predict', 'future', 'employee', 'turnover', 'recommendations', 'include', 'changing', 'navy', 'recruitment', 'process', 'allow', 'time', 'match', 'applicants', 'best', 'fit', 'jobs', 'utilizing', 'subjective', 'measurements', 'interest', 'inventory', 'cognitive', 'fit', 'job', 'placement', 'results', 'benefit', 'navy', 'services', 'organizations', 'offering', 'new', 'ideas', 'measure', 'cognitive', 'fit', 'exploring', 'ways', 'improve', 'hiring', 'process', 'optimizing', 'placement', 'utilization', 'retention', 'personnel']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement
Differentiating Management and Leadership in the U.S. Army: Lessons Learned from the Civlian Sector,"Distinctions between leadership and management have been debated for nearly forty years, but few studies provide empirical evidence regarding the utility of a distinction. The U.S. Army has extensive leadership development programs but no comparable programs for managers. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively examine the distinction between leadership and management in the U.S. Army. Thirty five lieutenant colonels participated in the survey. Results indicated that lieutenant colonels distinguished between leadership and management, rating leadership as more desirable and valuable, and indicated that majors should be more proficient at leadership than management subskills though they indicated that majors perform management subskills more frequently than leadership subskills.

How to Tell Stories Using Visualization: Strategies Towards Narrative Visualization,"Os benefícios da utilização das narrativas são desde há muito conhecidos e o seu potencial para simplificar conceitos, transmitir valores culturais e experiências, criar ligações emocionais e capacidade para ajudar a reter a informação tem sido explorado em diferentes áreas. As narrativas não são só a principal forma como as pessoas obtêm o sentido do mundo, mas também a forma mais fácil que encontrámos para partilhar informações complexas. Devido ao seu potencial, as narrativas foram recentemente abordadas na área da Visualização de Informação e do Conhecimento, muitas vezes apelidada de Visualização Narrativa. Esta questão é particularmente importante para os media, uma das áreas que tem impulsionado a investigação em Visualização Narrativa. A necessidade de incorporar histórias nas visualizações surge da necessidade de partilhar dados complexos de um modo envolvente. Hoje em dia somos confrontados com a elevada quantidade de informação disponível, um desafio difícil de resolver. Os avanços da tecnologia permitiram ir além das formas tradicionais de narrativa e de representação de dados, dando-nos meios mais atraentes e sofisticados para contar histórias. Nesta tese, exploro os benefícios da introdução de narrativas nas visualizações. Adicionalmente também exploro formas de combinar histórias com a visualizações e métodos eficientes para representar e dar sentido aos dados de uma forma que permite que as pessoas se relacionem com a informação.

Exploring the Influence of Design Thinking on the Decision Making of Army Leaders,"Military operations conducted in an asymmetric environment challenges the creative and critical thinking skills of Army leaders. An objective exploration of the influence of design thinking within Army doctrine was clearly appropriate to assess the level of influence experienced by Army leaders as they employed design thinking doctrine during problem solving and decision making activities. The United States Army introduced the concept of design thinking into their doctrine at the Command and General Staff College (CGSC) as a means of educating officers in how to apply critical and creative thinking techniques to solve complex ill-structured problems. The nature of conflict around the world has shifted toward an asymmetric environment as the enemy employs terrorist tactics as a means to further their political or ideological agenda. The U.S. Army responded to this shift in environments by adapting the design thinking concept within their doctrine entitled Army Design Methodology. The fundamental pretext of design thinking better prepares Army leaders by improving their abilities to apply creative and critical thinking skills as they conduct military operations in the ever-changing environment. The purpose of this generic qualitative research was to explore perceptions of how design thinking influenced Army commanders or their staff during problem solving and decision-making efforts in support of military operations. A selection of graduates from the Army School of Advanced Military Studies served as the target population for this survey. This qualitative research study evaluated their perceptions of how Army Design Methodology influenced their abilities to engage in problem solving and decision-making. The finding in this research study indicate Army Design Methodology enjoys a significant level of influence, and was applied to solve large problems and was employed predominantly at the division level and above. Challenges occurred as confusion existed when applying Army Design Methodology on simple problems or applied incorrectly. Resistance to the use of Army Design Methodology appeared to have been influenced in some measure by existing Army culture. Conclusions of this research indicate the implementation of an information campaign, which consists of both training and education is appropriate to institutionalize a better understanding of Army Design Methodology.",1868501434,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Kitzhaber, Gerry L.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

"Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Agency (JIDA) Technology Development/Identification, Acquisition and Support: An Exploratory Case Study","The acceleration of technology evolution and proliferation challenged the Department of Defense to develop/identify, acquire, and support technology-based programs. The Department of Defense became a highly specialized and relatively small user community. The specific problem investigated was challenges faced by the Department of Defense and the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Agency leaders when developing/identifying, acquiring, and supporting technology-based programs. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore how the current Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Agency leadership guided technology-based programs. The case study explored the processes mandated by the Department of Defense and the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Agency leadership. Three evidentiary sources, documents, interviews with Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Agency leadership, and questionnaires from Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Agency personnel were utilized. The study resulted in recommendations for process improvement by the Department of Defense leadership based upon the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Agency leadership experience developing/identifying, acquiring, and supporting technology-based systems. The recommendations identified were the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution process for improvement through more flexibility in the funding of technology-based programs. The other improvement recommendation was the Defense Acquisition System for an expansion of the guidelines relative to using the rapid acquisition process. Future studies could explore other Department of Defense organizations performing rapid acquisition as well as commercial corporations, public law and the congressional process for appropriating funds.",1854134524,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Avooske, Jonathan",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2016," Social sciences , Acquisition , Business process , Department of defense , JIDA , Rapid acquisition , Technology", 978-1-369-35902-2,,, English, English,,,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/joint-improvised-threat-defeat-agency-jida/docview/1854134524/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Joint+Improvised-Threat+Defeat+Agency+%28JIDA%29+Technology+Development%2FIdentification%2C+Acquisition+and+Support%3A+An+Exploratory+Case+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Avooske%2C+Jonathan&amp;isbn=978-1-369-35902-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",acceleration technology evolution proliferation challenged acquire support program became highly specialized relatively small user community specific problem investigated challenge faced joint defeat agency leader acquiring supporting program purpose qualitative case explore current joint defeat agency leadership guided program case explored process mandated joint defeat agency leadership three evidentiary source document interview joint defeat agency leadership questionnaire joint defeat agency personnel utilized resulted recommendation process improvement leadership based upon joint defeat agency leadership experience acquiring supporting system recommendation identified planning programming budgeting execution process improvement flexibility funding program improvement recommendation acquisition system expansion guideline relative using rapid acquisition process future study could explore organization performing rapid acquisition well commercial corporation public law congressional process appropriating fund,"['acceleration', 'technology', 'evolution', 'proliferation', 'challenged', 'acquire', 'support', 'programs', 'became', 'highly', 'specialized', 'relatively', 'small', 'user', 'community', 'specific', 'problem', 'investigated', 'challenges', 'faced', 'joint', 'defeat', 'agency', 'leaders', 'acquiring', 'supporting', 'programs', 'purpose', 'qualitative', 'case', 'explore', 'current', 'joint', 'defeat', 'agency', 'leadership', 'guided', 'programs', 'case', 'explored', 'processes', 'mandated', 'joint', 'defeat', 'agency', 'leadership', 'three', 'evidentiary', 'sources', 'documents', 'interviews', 'joint', 'defeat', 'agency', 'leadership', 'questionnaires', 'joint', 'defeat', 'agency', 'personnel', 'utilized', 'resulted', 'recommendations', 'process', 'improvement', 'leadership', 'based', 'upon', 'joint', 'defeat', 'agency', 'leadership', 'experience', 'acquiring', 'supporting', 'systems', 'recommendations', 'identified', 'planning', 'programming', 'budgeting', 'execution', 'process', 'improvement', 'flexibility', 'funding', 'programs', 'improvement', 'recommendation', 'acquisition', 'system', 'expansion', 'guidelines', 'relative', 'using', 'rapid', 'acquisition', 'process', 'future', 'studies', 'could', 'explore', 'organizations', 'performing', 'rapid', 'acquisition', 'well', 'commercial', 'corporations', 'public', 'law', 'congressional', 'process', 'appropriating', 'funds']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Job Satisfaction in the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency,"Approximately every 20 years, a new generation is born and eventually dominates the workforce; although changes occur with each new generation, the importance of job satisfaction remains constant. Research within the U.S. Intelligence Community is lacking with regard to changing trends of job satisfaction levels. The purpose of this study was to explore job satisfaction levels between Generation X and Generation Y workforce employees at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). The central research question addressed how job satisfaction differed by generational differences in the workforce. A quantitative method was used to assess survey data. A structural equation modeling technique was used to simultaneously test the plausibility of variable relationships to include the following: independent variables—compensation, environment, advancement, performance, training, supervision, motivation, demographics, leadership; and the dependent variable, job satisfaction. Regarding theoretical construct, the McGregor theories X and Y was used to address 2 fundamental approaches that affected job satisfaction levels exclusive to Generation X and Y. Full-time NGA employees from the Analysis and Production Directorate completed a survey to assess whether generational differences affected employees’ job satisfaction. Key findings indicated that Generation X employees associated job satisfaction as a measure of respect for their positions within NGA and Generation Y employees viewed job satisfaction as a measure of advancement and performance.

Strategies for Implementing a Successful Enterprise Resource Planning System,"The U.S. Department of Defense executives consider enterprise resource planning systems as a critical technology because of increasingly global operations and audit compliance pressures, which may affect organizational performance and overall success. The estimated cost to implement enterprise resources systems to avoid failure and meet budget cost across the Department of Defense services and agencies has ranged from $530 million to $2.4 billion. Guided by the general systems theory, the purpose of this single-case study was to explore enterprise resource planning strategies developed and implemented by United States Marine Corps military leaders. Data collection consisted of a review of organizational documents and semistructured interviews of 5 organizational leaders in a United States Marine Corps base in Albany, Georgia. Data analysis entailed interview transcription, keyword and phrase coding, and emergent theme identification. The prominent emergent themes were essential strategic planning guidance and organizational leaders and change management, which are the essential components for effectively implementing enterprise resource planning systems. The Department of Defense executives and senior leaders may use the findings of this study to develop an essential strategic plan, which could reduce the excessive cost and over-budget associated with enterprise resource planning systems.

"The relationship between U.S. Federal Governments cost estimates, service contract costs, and cost overruns","Researchers speculate, there is an inconsistent use of U.S. Federal Government cost estimates in the U.S. Federal Government procurement dynamics, i.e., budget forecasting. Researchers and leaders hypothesized cost overruns were acceptable standards of practice. In 2013, U.S. Federal Government service contracts made up at least 50% of the contract actions as a whole. The purpose of the current quantitative, correlational study was to determine the relationship between U.S. Federal Government cost estimates, U.S. Federal Government services contract costs, and cost overruns. An archival data review from public accessible websites, i.e., Federal Procurement Data System was conducted. The population addressed in the study consisted of 32,200 U.S. Federal Government service contracts at U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Army’s Proving Grounds, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Aberdeen, Maryland dated January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013. A G*power analysis statistical software recommended a sample size of N=29 to complete the study. The outcome of the study disclosed a correlation (-1.000 and +1.000 and Sig.

Utilizing the SETR process in the procurement of TPSs on the CASS Family of Testers,"Conference Title: 2015 IEEE AUTOTESTCON Conference Start Date: 2015, Nov. 2 Conference End Date: 2015, Nov. 5 Conference Location: National Harbor, MD, USA The acquisition of Operational Test Program Sets (OTPSs) has been a recurring effort requiring standardization, refinement, and continuous process improvement. Established in 1989, by the 'Red Team' integrated product team (IPT) and updated in 2005 as the NAVAIR Generic OTPS Request for Proposal (NGOR), the NGOR acquisition package is used as a Government template in the procurement of OTPSs being obtained for the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) Family of Testers (FoT). This acquisition package has been through several minor and major changes since inception. It has included review and recommendations from all Department of Defense services to include the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Marines, and U.S. Navy. These services and commercial industry use the NGOR as a reference and guidance for future bids and proposals. Foreign entities have also attributed ideas to include approved Foreign Military Sales (FMS). In 2014, the NGOR was revamped to include the NAVAIR Systems Engineering Technical Review (SETR) process. The rigorous and defined process assesses the technical, logistical, and programmatic health of design and development of an OTPS procurement. This paper will further enhance the understanding of this process by assessing the role and value the NAVAIR SETR process has in the acquisition, development, and over all life cycle management of Test Program Sets (TPSs) for the CASS FoT. This assessment will include the total acquisition life cycle from the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to the Materiel Support Date (MSD). Additionally, this paper will identify the changes made to the NGOR to incorporate SETR relative to the Statement of Work (SOW), Performance Specification, Contract Attachments, and Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs). This assessment comprises a discussion on OTPS and TPS system performance specification requirements (both generic and specific), SETR milestone and technical events' entry criteria, SETR checklist prerequisites specific to planned contract events, logistical needs, and federal regulatory and statutory requirements.",1750096053,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Heyn, Bill;Shilling, Bob",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Benchmarking contract management process maturity: a case study of the US Navy,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the results of contract management process maturity assessments in the US Navy using a process capability maturity model. The maturity model is used to benchmark an organization's contract management process maturity and to use the assessment results to develop a road map for implementing process improvement as well as knowledge-sharing initiatives. Design/methodology/approach - This is survey-based research on benchmarking contract management processes in the US Navy. A web-based assessment tool was deployed to US Navy contracting officers located at aeronautical systems, sea systems, and logistics support contracting agencies. The assessment tool consists of survey items related to the use of contracting best practices. The survey responses are then used to calculate the agency's contract management process maturity level. Findings - The benchmarking results reflected higher maturity levels in the pre-award contracting processes (Procurement Planning, Solicitation Planning, and Source Selection), while lower maturity levels were reflected in the post-award contracting processes (Contract Administration and Contract Closeout). The research findings related to process capability enablers also reflected higher mean scores for the pre-award processes and lower mean scores for the post-award processes. These maturity levels and process capability enabler scores reflect the extent of the implementation of contracting best practices within the Navy contracting agencies. Research limitations/implications - This research uses a purposeful sampling approach designed to acquire data on organizational contract management processes. The assessment survey was administered only to qualified Navy contracting officers. The Navy contracting agencies are responsible for procuring billions of dollars in supplies and services in support of the Navy mission. Although the assessed contracting agencies procure different types of systems, supplies, and services, the contract management processes used are common to all Navy, Army, Air Force, and other US federal government agencies. The conclusions based on the analysis of these benchmarking assessments may be applicable to Department of Defense (DoD) and other government agencies. Practical implications - The findings suggest that benchmarking can be effective in measuring and improving contracting process capability within the Navy. Benchmarking contracting processes can have far-reaching effects throughout the DoD. The Under Secretary of Defense's has mandated initiatives related to improving both pre- and post-award contracting processes. The use of these benchmarking assessments can be instrumental in tracking the achievements of these process improvement initiatives. Additionally, the US Congress is leading the push for auditability in procurement operations. By benchmarking and improving its contracting processes, the DoD will be winning the battle toward integrity, accountability, and transparency of its financial operations. Social implications - Benchmarking contracting processes can also have far-reaching effects in society. Many governments are focussing on integrity, accountability, and transparency in public procurement. International organizations such as Transparency International (TI) have identified process capability and process integrity as key for reducing the potential for procurement-related fraud, waste, and abuse. Additionally, NATO member countries and partner nations are focussing on the value of assessing and improving procurement processes for strengthening transparency and accountability. The value of benchmarking and improving contracting processes is gaining much attention in global public procurement agencies as they strive for accountability, integrity, and transparency in their governance processes. Originality/value - There are multiple reports on deficiencies in DoD's contract management processes, identifying poor contract planning, and Contract Administration as just some of the critically deficient areas. In response, the DoD is increasing its emphasis on developing its workforce competence through education initiatives. However, very little attention is being paid to benchmarking contract management processes. This research reflects the value of benchmarking DoD's contract management process maturity and using the results for implementing process improvement initiatives. Using process benchmarking data, agencies can identify process improvement initiatives that will ensure government tax dollars are spent in the most effective and efficient ways.",1716903571,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Rendon, Rene G.",, Navy-US, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited							 2015,10.1108/BIJ-10-2014-0096,," Case Study , Journal Article",, 2015," Accountability ,

A Roadmap of How One Governor Used Economic Development to Create a New Virginia Economy-Part Two,"When Gov Terence McAuliffe took office in January 2014, Virginia faced economic development challenges. As the top recipient of US Department of Defense contracts, the Commonwealth's economy is one of the hardest hit by the federal government's spending cuts to military and domestic programs. What makes the situation in Virginia stand out is its governor's proactive, long-term strategy to turn the state into a global leader in economic development. His hands-on approach starts with his personal involvement in major decisions impacting businesses, and continues as he works on the frontlines, recruiting companies into the state. In this article the author discusses the indirect, big-picture incentives intended to provide staying power to the governor's plan. Then he'll look at a real-world example of how the plan has succeeded in bringing jobs and tax dollars back to Virginia. Finally, he'll touch on some of the all-too-familiar challenges that lie ahead.",1735020103,,,Trade Journals,,"Potter, Kevin",,, Copyright Thomson Reuters (Tax & Accounting) Inc Sep 2015,,, Feature,, Sep 2015," Unemployment , Development , Virginia , Governor , Economic development , Governance",,1533-3124,6.0, English, English,, 28-30, Boston,Sep 2015,Journal of Multistate Taxation and Incentives,2015,,25.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/roadmap-how-one-governor-used-economic/docview/1735020103/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aaccounting&amp;atitle=A+Roadmap+of+How+One+Governor+Used+Economic+Development+to+Create+a+New+Virginia+Economy-Part+Two&amp;title=Journal+of+Multistate+Taxation+and+Incentives&amp;issn=15333124&amp;date=2015-09-01&amp;volume=25&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=28&amp;au=Potter%2C+Kevin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Multistate+Taxation+and+Incentives&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,gov terence mcauliffe took office january virginia faced economic development challenge top recipient contract commonwealth economy one hardest hit federal government spending cut domestic program make situation virginia stand governor proactive strategy turn state global leader economic development start personal involvement major decision impacting business continues work frontlines recruiting company state article author discusses indirect incentive intended provide staying power governor plan look example plan succeeded bringing job tax dollar back virginia finally touch challenge lie ahead,"['gov', 'terence', 'mcauliffe', 'took', 'office', 'january', 'virginia', 'faced', 'economic', 'development', 'challenges', 'top', 'recipient', 'contracts', 'commonwealth', 'economy', 'one', 'hardest', 'hit', 'federal', 'government', 'spending', 'cuts', 'domestic', 'programs', 'makes', 'situation', 'virginia', 'stand', 'governor', 'proactive', 'strategy', 'turn', 'state', 'global', 'leader', 'economic', 'development', 'starts', 'personal', 'involvement', 'major', 'decisions', 'impacting', 'businesses', 'continues', 'works', 'frontlines', 'recruiting', 'companies', 'state', 'article', 'author', 'discusses', 'indirect', 'incentives', 'intended', 'provide', 'staying', 'power', 'governor', 'plan', 'look', 'example', 'plan', 'succeeded', 'bringing', 'jobs', 'tax', 'dollars', 'back', 'virginia', 'finally', 'touch', 'challenges', 'lie', 'ahead']",Feature,2,Management and Leadership
Systems engineering framework for cyber physical security and resilience,"Issue Title: Special Issue: Risk to Resilience: Emergent Threats and Large-Scale Systems; Editors: Igor Linkov, James H. Lambert As our infrastructure, economy, and national defense increasingly rely upon cyberspace and information technology, the security of the systems that support these functions becomes more critical. Recent proclamations from the White House, Department of Defense, and elsewhere have called for increased resilience in our cyber capabilities. The growth of cyber threats extends well beyond the traditional areas of security managed by Information Technology software. The new cyber threats are introduced through vulnerabilities in infrastructures and industries supporting IT capital and operations. These vulnerabilities drive establishment of the area of cyber physical systems security. Cyber physical systems security integrates security into a wide range of interdependent computing systems and adjacent systems architectures. However, the concept of cyber physical system security is poorly understood, and the approach to manage vulnerabilities is fragmented. As cyber physical systems security is better understood, it will require a risk management framework that includes an integrated approach across physical, information, cognitive, and social domains to ensure resilience. The expanse of the threat environment will require a systems engineering approach to ensure wider, collaborative resiliency. Approaching cyber physical system security through the lens of resilience will enable the application of both integrated and targeted security measures and policies that ensure the continued functionality of critical services provided by our cyber infrastructure.",1687807772,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Dimase, Daniel;Collier, Zachary A;Heffner, Kenneth;Linkov, Igor",,, Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015,10.1007/s10669-015-9540-y,, Feature,, Jun 2015," Resilience , Cyber threats , Systems engineering , Physical security , Risk management",,2194-5403,2.0, English, English,, 291-300, New York,Jun 2015,Environment Systems & Decisions,2015,,35.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/systems-engineering-framework-cyber-physical/docview/1687807772/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Systems+engineering+framework+for+cyber+physical+security+and+resilience&amp;title=Environment+Systems+%26+Decisions&amp;issn=21945403&amp;date=2015-06-01&amp;volume=35&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=291&amp;au=Dimase%2C+Daniel%3BCollier%2C+Zachary+A%3BHeffner%2C+Kenneth%3BLinkov%2C+Igor&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environment+Systems+%26+Decisions&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10669-015-9540-y,"ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",issue title special issue risk resilience emergent threat system editor igor linkov james lambert infrastructure economy national increasingly rely upon cyberspace information technology security system support function becomes critical recent proclamation white house elsewhere called increased resilience cyber capability growth cyber threat extends well beyond traditional area security managed information technology software new cyber threat introduced vulnerability infrastructure industry supporting capital operation vulnerability drive establishment area cyber physical system security cyber physical system security integrates security wide range interdependent computing system adjacent system architecture however concept cyber physical system security poorly understood manage vulnerability fragmented cyber physical system security better understood require risk management framework includes integrated across physical information cognitive social domain ensure resilience expanse threat environment require system engineering ensure wider collaborative resiliency approaching cyber physical system security lens resilience enable application integrated targeted security measure policy ensure continued functionality critical service provided cyber infrastructure,"['issue', 'title', 'special', 'issue', 'risk', 'resilience', 'emergent', 'threats', 'systems', 'editors', 'igor', 'linkov', 'james', 'lambert', 'infrastructure', 'economy', 'national', 'increasingly', 'rely', 'upon', 'cyberspace', 'information', 'technology', 'security', 'systems', 'support', 'functions', 'becomes', 'critical', 'recent', 'proclamations', 'white', 'house', 'elsewhere', 'called', 'increased', 'resilience', 'cyber', 'capabilities', 'growth', 'cyber', 'threats', 'extends', 'well', 'beyond', 'traditional', 'areas', 'security', 'managed', 'information', 'technology', 'software', 'new', 'cyber', 'threats', 'introduced', 'vulnerabilities', 'infrastructures', 'industries', 'supporting', 'capital', 'operations', 'vulnerabilities', 'drive', 'establishment', 'area', 'cyber', 'physical', 'systems', 'security', 'cyber', 'physical', 'systems', 'security', 'integrates', 'security', 'wide', 'range', 'interdependent', 'computing', 'systems', 'adjacent', 'systems', 'architectures', 'however', 'concept', 'cyber', 'physical', 'system', 'security', 'poorly', 'understood', 'manage', 'vulnerabilities', 'fragmented', 'cyber', 'physical', 'systems', 'security', 'better', 'understood', 'require', 'risk', 'management', 'framework', 'includes', 'integrated', 'across', 'physical', 'information', 'cognitive', 'social', 'domains', 'ensure', 'resilience', 'expanse', 'threat', 'environment', 'require', 'systems', 'engineering', 'ensure', 'wider', 'collaborative', 'resiliency', 'approaching', 'cyber', 'physical', 'system', 'security', 'lens', 'resilience', 'enable', 'application', 'integrated', 'targeted', 'security', 'measures', 'policies', 'ensure', 'continued', 'functionality', 'critical', 'services', 'provided', 'cyber', 'infrastructure']",Feature,3,Process Improvement

Frigate Update,"Admirals, sailors, naval buffs, and historians should be thankful to the friends of Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus. According to Mr. Mabus, he directed that the littoral combat ship (LCS) be redesignated as a frigate because he got tired of having to explain to his friends the meaning of the word ""littoral."" In reality, for some two years the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Naval History and Heritage Command, with assistance from a few private individuals, have been grappling with the problem of the LCS designation -- and those of a few other ships that were arbitrarily given designations outside of the Navy's carefully crafted ""system."" Under the recent Department of Defense directive to ""up-gun"" the LCS (now frigate), the last 28 ships of the planned 52 units will be built as frigates -- half of them by Lockheed Martin based on the USS Freedom (LCS-1) design and half by Austal USA derived from the USS Independence (LCS-2) design.",1660495026,,,Trade Journals,,"Polmar, Norman", XNIPAN, Austal USA, Copyright United States Naval Institute Mar 2015,,, Feature,, Mar 2015," Frigate , Naval warfare",,0041-798X,3.0, English, English,, 88-89, Annapolis,Mar 2015,United States Naval Institute.

Design and Implementation of the VLF Wave and Particle Precipitation Mapper Sensor Suite,"The VLF Wave and Particle precipitation Mapper (VPM) Sensor Suite will serve as a complement to ongoing DoD programs aimed at qualification of controlled precipitation of energetic electron radiation by ELF/VLF whistler-mode waves. Two benefitting programs are the Air Force Demonstration and Science Experiment (DSX) satellite mission, and the High frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP). New capabilities provided by VPM are afforded by a dual detector configuration that provides sensitive measurements of energetic electrons both just-inside and just-outside the bounce loss cone, and by wave receivers with GPS-based timing facilitating interferometric measurements of electron density irregularities. The VPM sensor suite will make use of novel VLF micro-receivers consisting of radiation-hardened (up to a 2 Mrad) Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), Anti-Aliasing Filter (AAF), and Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) developed over the past 6 years in the context of three student PhD theses. These devices provide the capability to conduct ELF/VLF observations at extremely low power and weight, while maintaining the high degree of sensitivity, resolution and dynamic range required in such measurements. Research areas of VPM will focus on determining energy spectra, temporal signatures, and spatial extent of energetic electron precipitation bursts induced by discrete whistler-mode waves, launched by ground-based sources: (i) lightning discharges, (ii) VLF transmitter signals (e.g., NPM, NAA, etc.), and (iii) ELF/VLF waves injected by modulated HF heating (i.e., HAARP). VPM will measure waves in broadband fashion so as to identify those from different sources, with high time and frequency resolution. It will simultaneously measure energetic particles with high sensitivity (large geometric factors), high time and energy resolution, so as to assess cause and affect relationships and determine calibrated theoretical models (by determining the flux levels that result from given levels of wave power density). VPM will also measure transmitted VLF wave intensity from the DSX/WIPER transmitter and determine transmitter efficiency, effective plasma sheath impedance and confirm dynamics of transmission process.",2501299071,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Ingram, Steven",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Improving Defense Acquisition Outcomes Using an Integrated Systems Engineering Decision Management (ISEDM) Approach,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has recently revised the defense acquisition system to address suspected root causes of unwanted acquisition outcomes. This dissertation applied two systems thinking methodologies in a uniquely integrated fashion to provide an in-depth review and interpretation of the revised defense acquisition system as put forth in 7 January 2015 DoDI 5000.02. One of the major changes in the revised acquisition system is an increased emphasis on systems engineering trade-offs made between capability requirements and lifecycle costs early in the acquisition process in order to ensure realistic program baselines are established such that associated lifecycle costs of a contemplated system are affordable within future budgets. Given that systems engineering trade-off analyses will play a pivotal role in future defense acquisition efforts, this research employed a two phase, exploratory sequential and embedded mixed methods approach (Creswell, 2014) to take an in-depth look at the state of literature surrounding systems engineering trade-off analyses, identify potential pitfalls associated with the typical execution of a systems engineering trade-off analysis, quantify the risk that potential pitfalls pose to acquisition decision quality, suggest remedies to mitigate the risk of each pitfall, and measure the potential usefulness of contemplated innovations that may help improve the quality of future systems engineering trade-off analyses. In the first phase of this mixed methods study, qualitative data was captured through field observations and direct interviews with U.S. defense acquisition professionals executing systems engineering trade analyses. In the second phase, a larger sample of systems engineering professionals and military operations research professionals involved in defense acquisition were surveyed to help interpret qualitative findings of the first phase. The survey instrument was designed using Survey Monkey and was deployed through a link posted on several groups within LinkedIn and was also sent directly via email to those with known experience in this research area. The survey was open for a two month period and collected responses from 181 participants. The findings and recommendations of this research were communicated in a thorough description of the integrated systems engineering decision management (ISEDM) process developed as part of this

Integrating the principles of total quality into the strategic planning process for a federal services acquisition organization,"The Executive and Legislative branches of the United States government instruct the Department of Defense (DOD) to pursue performance excellence with a focus on strategic planning, quality management, and continuous improvement. Unfortunately, the Government Accountability Office reported in 2013 that the DOD is struggling to develop and execute a business strategy, specifically stating that proactive performance management and results are lacking. The aim of this project is to identify required strategic planning functions and to develop a new approach that incorporates the guiding principles of total quality. Essentially, this project demonstrates how a DOD organization can integrate customer requirements, align and engage the workforce, control costs, and focus on continuous process improvement in effort to pursue performance excellence. A detailed research and analysis of the findings are performed accordingly, which has produced standard strategic management instructions and an associated strategic plan as well as identify additional research opportunities.",1768696868,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Gray, John E.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2015," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Organizational Behavior , Quality Systems Engineering , Strategic Management , Strategic Planning , Systems Thinking , Total Quality", 978-1-339-50507-7,,, English, English,,,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/integrating-principles-total-quality-into/docview/1768696868/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Integrating+the+principles+of+total+quality+into+the+strategic+planning+process+for+a+federal+services+acquisition+organization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gray%2C+John+E.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-50507-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,executive legislative branch united state government instruct pursue performance excellence focus strategic planning quality management continuous improvement unfortunately government accountability office reported struggling develop execute business strategy specifically stating proactive performance management result lacking aim project identify required strategic planning function develop new incorporates guiding principle total quality essentially project demonstrates organization integrate customer requirement align engage workforce control cost focus continuous process improvement effort pursue performance excellence detailed finding performed accordingly produced standard strategic management instruction associated strategic plan well identify additional opportunity,"['executive', 'legislative', 'branches', 'united', 'states', 'government', 'instruct', 'pursue', 'performance', 'excellence', 'focus', 'strategic', 'planning', 'quality', 'management', 'continuous', 'improvement', 'unfortunately', 'government', 'accountability', 'office', 'reported', 'struggling', 'develop', 'execute', 'business', 'strategy', 'specifically', 'stating', 'proactive', 'performance', 'management', 'results', 'lacking', 'aim', 'project', 'identify', 'required', 'strategic', 'planning', 'functions', 'develop', 'new', 'incorporates', 'guiding', 'principles', 'total', 'quality', 'essentially', 'project', 'demonstrates', 'organization', 'integrate', 'customer', 'requirements', 'align', 'engage', 'workforce', 'control', 'costs', 'focus', 'continuous', 'process', 'improvement', 'effort', 'pursue', 'performance', 'excellence', 'detailed', 'findings', 'performed', 'accordingly', 'produced', 'standard', 'strategic', 'management', 'instructions', 'associated', 'strategic', 'plan', 'well', 'identify', 'additional', 'opportunities']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
APPLICATION OF LEAN SIX SIGMA PROCESS IMPROVEMENT AT TOBYHANNA ARMY DEPOT,"Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) provides a large part of the Army's logistics support. They work with Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) throughout the Department of Defense. Tobyhanna has adopted Lean Six Sigma as their primary means for Continuous Process Improvement moving forward and adopting increasing missions with limited resources. Lean Six Sigma uses the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) methodology attempting to eliminate waste and improve the quality of their processes. One of Tobyhanna's many missions is distributing both hazardous material (HAZMAT) and non-hazardous material to locations around the world where Mobile Depot Maintenance (MDM) teams are deployed. These teams submit orders for equipment and supplies needed to complete their maintenance mission, and Tobyhanna, working with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), gets the equipment/supplies, packs it, and sends it. Many different variables are in play in the process including the shipment of HAZMAT and regulations between DLA and TYAD. The project they are adopting is one in which they will attempt to improve the proportion of deliveries arriving on time, accuracy of items in each delivery, and accuracy of delivery location for MDM shipment missions.",1751245896,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Carstensen, Andrew;Korycinski, Donna;Nehring, Richard;Stone, Philip;Wilson, Lara;Condrad, Jennifer;Rawhouser, Brian",,, Copyright American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM) 2015,,, Feature,, 2015," Lean Six Sigma , Six Sigma , DMAIC , Dangerous goods , Hazmat , Lean",,,, English, English,, 1-10, Huntsville,2015,Proceedings of the International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management.,2015,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/application-lean-six-sigma-process-improvement-at/docview/1751245896/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=APPLICATION+OF+LEAN+SIX+SIGMA+PROCESS+IMPROVEMENT+AT+TOBYHANNA+ARMY+DEPOT&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Carstensen%2C+Andrew%3BKorycinski%2C+Donna%3BNehring%2C+Richard%3BStone%2C+Philip%3BWilson%2C+Lara%3BCondrad%2C+Jennifer%3BRawhouser%2C+Brian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",tobyhanna army depot tyad provides large part army logistics support work command control communication computer intelligence surveillance reconnaissance throughout tobyhanna adopted lean six sigma primary mean continuous process improvement moving forward adopting increasing mission limited resource lean six sigma us dmaic attempting eliminate waste improve quality process one tobyhanna many mission distributing hazardous material hazmat material location around world mobile depot maintenance mdm team deployed team submit order equipment supply needed complete maintenance mission tobyhanna working logistics agency dla get pack sends many different variable play process including shipment hazmat regulation dla tyad project adopting one attempt improve proportion delivery arriving time accuracy item delivery accuracy delivery location mdm shipment mission,"['tobyhanna', 'army', 'depot', 'tyad', 'provides', 'large', 'part', 'army', 'logistics', 'support', 'work', 'command', 'control', 'communications', 'computers', 'intelligence', 'surveillance', 'reconnaissance', 'throughout', 'tobyhanna', 'adopted', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'primary', 'means', 'continuous', 'process', 'improvement', 'moving', 'forward', 'adopting', 'increasing', 'missions', 'limited', 'resources', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'uses', 'dmaic', 'attempting', 'eliminate', 'waste', 'improve', 'quality', 'processes', 'one', 'tobyhanna', 'many', 'missions', 'distributing', 'hazardous', 'material', 'hazmat', 'material', 'locations', 'around', 'world', 'mobile', 'depot', 'maintenance', 'mdm', 'teams', 'deployed', 'teams', 'submit', 'orders', 'equipment', 'supplies', 'needed', 'complete', 'maintenance', 'mission', 'tobyhanna', 'working', 'logistics', 'agency', 'dla', 'gets', 'packs', 'sends', 'many', 'different', 'variables', 'play', 'process', 'including', 'shipment', 'hazmat', 'regulations', 'dla', 'tyad', 'project', 'adopting', 'one', 'attempt', 'improve', 'proportion', 'deliveries', 'arriving', 'time', 'accuracy', 'items', 'delivery', 'accuracy', 'delivery', 'location', 'mdm', 'shipment', 'missions']",Feature,2,Process Improvement

Program Evaluation: A Federal Agency's Air Traffic Control Train-the-Trainer Program,"In 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) highlighted to the U.S. Senate the need to focus on air traffic control (ATC) training to meet job qualification and attrition rates within the career field. One U.S. Department of Defense military service assists the FAA in providing worldwide ATC services. This service is referred to as the agency throughout this paper to ensure confidentiality. The agency’s ATC career field manager echoed the FAA’s call for action in his 2014 Strategic/Action Plan. In August 2013, the agency’s ATC trainer program was published. As of December 2015, the program had not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to ascertain if the program facilitated the learning of critical ATC on-the-job training skills. An ad hoc expertise-oriented evaluation was conducted using the lenses of andragogy, experiential learning, and instructional system design (ISD). Purposeful sampling procedures were used to select 20 participants across the subgroups of supervisors, trainers, managers, and training developers from 7 focus sites. The semi-structured interviews queried 4 topical areas derived from Kirkpatrick’s 4 levels of evaluation model. Data collected via documents and interviews were analyzed using descriptive, emotion, eclectic, and pattern coding. Key findings indicated that the program was not developed compliant with ISD principles and did not promote adult learning as endorsed by andragogy and experiential learning theory. The implications for positive social change include providing stakeholders with data needed to make evidence-based decisions regarding the current and future state of the program. The evaluation report project can be shared with the FAA, an agency partner, and has the potential to create a platform for improved training practices focusing on optimum and successful adult learning transactions.",1750077658,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Mercer, Lisa M.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2015," Social sciences , Education , Qualitative research , Interviews , Air traffic control , Air traffic control training , Andragogy , Experiential learning , Instructional system design , Program evaluation", 978-1-339-32372-5,,, English, English,,,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/program-evaluation-federal-agencys-air-traffic/docview/1750077658/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Program+Evaluation%3A+A+Federal+Agency%27s+Air+Traffic+Control+Train-the-Trainer+Program&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mercer%2C+Lisa+M.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-32372-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",federal aviation administration faa highlighted senate need focus air traffic control atc training meet job qualification attrition rate within career field one service assist faa providing worldwide atc service service referred agency throughout ensure confidentiality agency atc career field manager echoed faa call action plan august agency atc trainer program published december program evaluated purpose ascertain program facilitated learning critical atc training skill hoc evaluation conducted using lens andragogy experiential learning instructional system design isd purposeful sampling procedure used select participant across subgroup supervisor trainer manager training developer focus site interview queried topical area derived kirkpatrick level evaluation model collected via document interview analyzed using descriptive emotion eclectic pattern coding key finding indicated program developed compliant isd principle promote adult learning endorsed andragogy experiential learning theory implication positive social change include providing stakeholder needed make decision regarding current future state program evaluation report project shared faa agency partner potential create platform improved training practice focusing optimum successful adult learning transaction,"['federal', 'aviation', 'administration', 'faa', 'highlighted', 'senate', 'need', 'focus', 'air', 'traffic', 'control', 'atc', 'training', 'meet', 'job', 'qualification', 'attrition', 'rates', 'within', 'career', 'field', 'one', 'service', 'assists', 'faa', 'providing', 'worldwide', 'atc', 'services', 'service', 'referred', 'agency', 'throughout', 'ensure', 'confidentiality', 'agency', 'atc', 'career', 'field', 'manager', 'echoed', 'faa', 'call', 'action', 'plan', 'august', 'agency', 'atc', 'trainer', 'program', 'published', 'december', 'program', 'evaluated', 'purpose', 'ascertain', 'program', 'facilitated', 'learning', 'critical', 'atc', 'training', 'skills', 'hoc', 'evaluation', 'conducted', 'using', 'lenses', 'andragogy', 'experiential', 'learning', 'instructional', 'system', 'design', 'isd', 'purposeful', 'sampling', 'procedures', 'used', 'select', 'participants', 'across', 'subgroups', 'supervisors', 'trainers', 'managers', 'training', 'developers', 'focus', 'sites', 'interviews', 'queried', 'topical', 'areas', 'derived', 'kirkpatrick', 'levels', 'evaluation', 'model', 'data', 'collected', 'via', 'documents', 'interviews', 'analyzed', 'using', 'descriptive', 'emotion', 'eclectic', 'pattern', 'coding', 'key', 'findings', 'indicated', 'program', 'developed', 'compliant', 'isd', 'principles', 'promote', 'adult', 'learning', 'endorsed', 'andragogy', 'experiential', 'learning', 'theory', 'implications', 'positive', 'social', 'change', 'include', 'providing', 'stakeholders', 'data', 'needed', 'make', 'decisions', 'regarding', 'current', 'future', 'state', 'program', 'evaluation', 'report', 'project', 'shared', 'faa', 'agency', 'partner', 'potential', 'create', 'platform', 'improved', 'training', 'practices', 'focusing', 'optimum', 'successful', 'adult', 'learning', 'transactions']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Analysis of Light Emitting Diode Technology for Aerospace Suitability in Human Space Flight Applications,"Commercial space designers are required to manage space flight designs in accordance with parts selections made from qualified parts listings approved by Department of Defense and NASA agencies for reliability and safety. The research problem was a government and private aerospace industry problem involving how LEDs cannot replace existing fluorescent lighting in manned space flight vehicles until such technology meets DOD and NASA requirements for reliability and safety, and effects on astronaut cognition and health. The purpose of this quantitative experimental study was to determine to what extent commercial LEDs can suitably meet NASA requirements for manufacturer reliability, color reliability, robustness to environmental test requirements, and degradation effects from operational power, while providing comfortable ambient light free of eyestrain to astronauts in lieu of current fluorescent lighting. A fractional factorial experiment tested white and blue LEDs for NASA required space flight environmental stress testing and applied operating current. The second phase of the study used a randomized block design, to test human factor effects of LEDs and a qualified ISS fluorescent for retinal fatigue and eye strain. Eighteen human subjects were recruited from university student members of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Findings for Phase 1 testing showed that commercial LEDs met all DOD and NASA requirements for manufacturer reliability, color reliability, robustness to environmental requirements, and degradation effects from operational power. Findings showed statistical significance for LED color and operational power variables but degraded light output levels did not fall below the industry recognized &lt;70%. Findings from Phase 2 human factors testing showed no statistically significant evidence that the NASA approved ISS fluorescent lights or blue or white LEDs caused fatigue, eye strain and/or headache, when study participants perform detailed tasks of reading and assembling mechanical parts for an extended period of two uninterrupted hours. However, human subjects self-reported that blue LEDs provided the most white light and the favored light source over the white LED and the ISS fluorescent as a sole artificial light source for space travel. According to NASA standards, findings from this study indicate that LEDs meet criteria for the NASA TRL 7 rating, as study findings showed that commercial LED manufacturers passed the rigorous testing standards of suitability for space flight environments and human factor effects. Recommendations for future research include further testing for space flight using the basis of this study for replication, but reduce study limitations by 1) testing human subjects exposure to LEDs in a simulated space capsule environment over several days, and 2) installing and testing LEDs in space modules being tested for human spaceflight.",1746623313,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Treichel,

Intelligence Community (IC) Performance Management: Did the Director of National Intelligence's (DNI) 2007 IC Policy Directive 651 on Performance Management Achieve its Policy Objectives?,"In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001, the Congress initiated a series of studies that concluded intelligence analysts had failed to “connect the dots” before the attacks because nobody was firmly in charge, individual and organizational responsibility and accountability were diffuse, and there were no common standards and personnel practices in place across the Intelligence Community (IC). In 2004, Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA), which established the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), directed the DNI to establish clear goals and set priorities, and to develop and implement common personnel standards across the IC. A new policy on performance management was established in 2008 and implemented over the following two years. This dissertation, based on empirical data and analysis of the implementation of the program, examines the effectiveness of the new performance management program. It concludes that the program worked reasonably well in the Department of Defense and independent agencies (though noting problems in implementation), but did not work as well in the smaller populations of IC employees scattered among the five other Departments. The policy implications of these findings will inform Congress and executive branch agencies on ways to improve congressional mandates and the implementation of performance management systems.",1726031268,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Coghlan, Thomas K.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2015," Social sciences , Government , Intelligence community , Management , Organization , Performance , Public policy", 978-1-339-01732-7,,, English, English,,,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/intelligence-community-ic-performance-management/docview/1726031268/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Intelligence+Community+%28IC%29+Performance+Management%3A+Did+the+Director+of+National+Intelligence%27s+%28DNI%29+2007+IC+Policy+Directive+651+on+Performance+Management+Achieve+its+Policy+Objectives%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Coghlan%2C+Thomas+K.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-01732-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,aftermath terrorist attack congress initiated series study concluded intelligence analyst failed connect dot attack nobody firmly charge individual organizational responsibility accountability diffuse common standard personnel practice place across intelligence community congress passed intelligence reform terrorism prevention act irtpa established director national intelligence dni directed dni establish clear goal set priority develop implement common personnel standard across new policy performance management established implemented following two year based empirical implementation program examines effectiveness new performance management program concludes program worked reasonably well independent agency though noting problem implementation work well smaller population employee scattered among five department policy implication finding inform congress executive branch agency way improve congressional mandate implementation performance management system,"['aftermath', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'congress', 'initiated', 'series', 'studies', 'concluded', 'intelligence', 'analysts', 'failed', 'connect', 'dots', 'attacks', 'nobody', 'firmly', 'charge', 'individual', 'organizational', 'responsibility', 'accountability', 'diffuse', 'common', 'standards', 'personnel', 'practices', 'place', 'across', 'intelligence', 'community', 'congress', 'passed', 'intelligence', 'reform', 'terrorism', 'prevention', 'act', 'irtpa', 'established', 'director', 'national', 'intelligence', 'dni', 'directed', 'dni', 'establish', 'clear', 'goals', 'set', 'priorities', 'develop', 'implement', 'common', 'personnel', 'standards', 'across', 'new', 'policy', 'performance', 'management', 'established', 'implemented', 'following', 'two', 'years', 'dissertation', 'based', 'empirical', 'data', 'implementation', 'program', 'examines', 'effectiveness', 'new', 'performance', 'management', 'program', 'concludes', 'program', 'worked', 'reasonably', 'well', 'independent', 'agencies', 'though', 'noting', 'problems', 'implementation', 'work', 'well', 'smaller', 'populations', 'employees', 'scattered', 'among', 'five', 'departments', 'policy', 'implications', 'findings', 'inform', 'congress', 'executive', 'branch', 'agencies', 'ways', 'improve', 'congressional', 'mandates', 'implementation', 'performance', 'management', 'systems']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Logistics outsourcing: The value of the relationship between a corporation and the 3PL contractor,"For a variety of reasons, the outsourcing of logistics functions to third party logistics providers (3PLs) has emerged as a powerful alternative to managing traditional internal logistical operations. In fact, outsourcing logistics functions is one of the prevailing strategies that enhance a company’s competitiveness. Given this business shift in the private sector, the purpose of this study was to determine whether the relationships between a government agency and their third party logistics provider share some of the same indicators of a strategic relationship common among corporate strategic alliances. Specifically, by looking at both the benefits and detriments of strategic alliances, this investigation was designed to find out if the Department of Defense had shifted the way it dealt with its logistics contractor in a similar manner to the shift that has occurred in the corporate world. This study used a qualitative approach and critical practicality to assess the dynamics of this relationship. Additionally, this study employed instruments used in previous studies administered to senior executives and students attending advance training in logistics operations and concepts. As detailed herein, the findings indicate three essential components for a successful 3PL relationship in the government sector: a high level of trust, transparent financial arrangements, and ongoing information sharing. The results of this study are expected to offer guidance on how government agencies can be more effective in dealing with their private sector providers. The findings presented herein may also provide the U.S. government with information that could help it replicate a legal model of the supplier-relationship management model that is so widely used in the private sector.",1687429467,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Hooks, Olivette M.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2015," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , 3PL , Contracts , Logistics , Management , Outsourcing , Relationship", 978-1-321-76851-0,,, English, English,,,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/logistics-outsourcing-value-relationship-between/docview/1687429467/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Logistics+outsourcing%3A+The+value+of+the+relationship+between+a+corporation+and+the+3PL+contractor&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hooks%2C+Olivette+M.&amp;isbn=978-1-321-76851-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,variety reason outsourcing logistics function third party logistics provider emerged powerful alternative managing traditional internal logistical operation fact outsourcing logistics function one prevailing strategy enhance company competitiveness given business shift private sector purpose determine whether relationship government agency third party logistics provider share indicator strategic relationship common among corporate strategic alliance specifically looking benefit detriment strategic alliance investigation designed find shifted way dealt logistics contractor similar manner shift occurred corporate world used qualitative critical practicality assess dynamic relationship additionally employed instrument used previous study administered senior executive student attending advance training logistics operation concept detailed herein finding indicate three essential component successful relationship government sector high level trust transparent financial arrangement ongoing information sharing result expected offer guidance government agency effective dealing private sector provider finding presented herein may also provide government information could help replicate legal model management model widely used private sector,"['variety', 'reasons', 'outsourcing', 'logistics', 'functions', 'third', 'party', 'logistics', 'providers', 'emerged', 'powerful', 'alternative', 'managing', 'traditional', 'internal', 'logistical', 'operations', 'fact', 'outsourcing', 'logistics', 'functions', 'one', 'prevailing', 'strategies', 'enhance', 'company', 'competitiveness', 'given', 'business', 'shift', 'private', 'sector', 'purpose', 'determine', 'whether', 'relationships', 'government', 'agency', 'third', 'party', 'logistics', 'provider', 'share', 'indicators', 'strategic', 'relationship', 'common', 'among', 'corporate', 'strategic', 'alliances', 'specifically', 'looking', 'benefits', 'detriments', 'strategic', 'alliances', 'investigation', 'designed', 'find', 'shifted', 'way', 'dealt', 'logistics', 'contractor', 'similar', 'manner', 'shift', 'occurred', 'corporate', 'world', 'used', 'qualitative', 'critical', 'practicality', 'assess', 'dynamics', 'relationship', 'additionally', 'employed', 'instruments', 'used', 'previous', 'studies', 'administered', 'senior', 'executives', 'students', 'attending', 'advance', 'training', 'logistics', 'operations', 'concepts', 'detailed', 'herein', 'findings', 'indicate', 'three', 'essential', 'components', 'successful', 'relationship', 'government', 'sector', 'high', 'level', 'trust', 'transparent', 'financial', 'arrangements', 'ongoing', 'information', 'sharing', 'results', 'expected', 'offer', 'guidance', 'government', 'agencies', 'effective', 'dealing', 'private', 'sector', 'providers', 'findings', 'presented', 'herein', 'may', 'also', 'provide', 'government', 'information', 'could', 'help', 'replicate', 'legal', 'model', 'management', 'model', 'widely', 'used', 'private', 'sector']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Improving Statistical Rigor in Department of Defense Test and Evaluation: Use of Tolerance Intervals in Designed Experiments,"Given the push to provide defensible test data in the Department of Defense (DoD) Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Enterprise, the use of statistical methods has taken center stage. This research investigates the applicability of statistical tolerance intervals in designed experiments as an analysis method for the DoD T&amp;E technical community. To date, tolerance intervals are scarcely discussed in extant literature as compared to confidence and prediction intervals. The lesser known tolerance intervals can assure a proportion of the population is captured in the design space with some confidence, and have the ability to map out the design space where factors can be reliably tested. Further, this research investigates several two-sided approximate tolerance factors estimated by Monte Carlo simulation and compares them to the exact method. Finally, its applicability to the defense T&amp;E community is presented using a simple case study.",1651235209,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Rucker, Alethea",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2015," Pure sciences , Social sciences , Applied sciences , Defense , Design of experiments , Statistics , Test and evaluation , Tolerance intervals", 978-1-321-47899-0,,, English, English,,,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/improving-statistical-rigor-department-defense/docview/1651235209/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Improving+Statistical+Rigor+in+Department+of+Defense+Test+and+Evaluation%3A+Use+of+Tolerance+Intervals+in+Designed+Experiments&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rucker%2C+Alethea&amp;isbn=978-1-321-47899-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,given push provide defensible test test evaluation amp enterprise use statistical method taken center stage investigates applicability statistical tolerance interval designed experiment amp technical community date tolerance interval scarcely discussed extant literature compared confidence prediction interval lesser known tolerance interval assure proportion population captured design space confidence ability map design space factor reliably tested investigates several approximate tolerance factor estimated monte carlo simulation compare exact finally applicability amp community presented using simple case,"['given', 'push', 'provide', 'defensible', 'test', 'data', 'test', 'evaluation', 'amp', 'enterprise', 'use', 'statistical', 'methods', 'taken', 'center', 'stage', 'investigates', 'applicability', 'statistical', 'tolerance', 'intervals', 'designed', 'experiments', 'amp', 'technical', 'community', 'date', 'tolerance', 'intervals', 'scarcely', 'discussed', 'extant', 'literature', 'compared', 'confidence', 'prediction', 'intervals', 'lesser', 'known', 'tolerance', 'intervals', 'assure', 'proportion', 'population', 'captured', 'design', 'space', 'confidence', 'ability', 'map', 'design', 'space', 'factors', 'reliably', 'tested', 'investigates', 'several', 'approximate', 'tolerance', 'factors', 'estimated', 'monte', 'carlo', 'simulation', 'compares', 'exact', 'finally', 'applicability', 'amp', 'community', 'presented', 'using', 'simple', 'case']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement

Polymer-Ceramic Nancomposites for Bone Regeneration,"Bone is a very important structure in the human body. In the craniomaxillofacial complex, trauma and pathological situations such as maxillofacial tumors produce major bone defects that cannot be healed by physiological processes. As a response to this problem, many strategies have been studied throughout the years, with the purpose to find a material that reunites ideal properties for regenerating or substituting the needed bone and therefore guarantee its physiological and structural functions. Among this strategies, transplantation of bone within the same individual (autografts), from another human being (allograft) or from an individual of another species (xenograft) have been studied and are clinically applied nowadays. However, these techniques revealed to have drawbacks such as donor site morbidity, risk of disease infection and immunological reactions. In this context, new solutions are needed. In the field of biomaterials, nanocomposites are considered a promising material for many outcomes, mainly because their nanometer-scale allows a superior structural performance, when compared to microcomposite materials. In the bone regeneration area, ceramic nanocomposites dispersed in a polymeric matrix are a promising solution, because they reassemble the physiological bone structure, adding unique biocompatible and stimulating properties to the already outstanding mechanical behavior. The investigation of the different types of ceramic-polymeric nanocomposites, as well as the co-factors that can be added to enhance the biological response and their processing ability for the commercial level, is extremely relevant. This study intends to present a review of the published information about the in vivo and in vitro studies that have been performed in the last 5 years and their contribution for the development of an ideal nanocomposite material to be used in bone regeneration, particularly in the craniomaxillofacial context.",2917305677,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"de Lacerda Schickert, Sónia",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2014,, 9798381253443,,, English, English,,,,2014,PQDT - Global,2014,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/polymer-ceramic-nancomposites-bone-regeneration/docview/2917305677/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Polymer-Ceramic+Nancomposites+for+Bone+Regeneration&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=de+Lacerda+Schickert%2C+S%C3%B3nia&amp;isbn=9798381253443&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,bone important structure human body craniomaxillofacial complex trauma pathological situation maxillofacial tumor produce major bone defect healed physiological process response problem many strategy studied throughout year purpose find material reunites ideal property regenerating substituting needed bone therefore guarantee physiological structural function among strategy transplantation bone within individual autograft another human allograft individual another specie xenograft studied clinically applied nowadays however technique revealed drawback donor site morbidity risk disease infection immunological reaction context new solution needed field biomaterials nanocomposites considered promising material many outcome mainly allows superior structural performance compared microcomposite material bone regeneration area ceramic nanocomposites dispersed polymeric matrix promising solution reassemble physiological bone structure adding unique biocompatible stimulating property already outstanding mechanical behavior investigation different type nanocomposites well added enhance biological response processing ability commercial level extremely relevant intends present review published information vivo vitro study performed last year contribution development ideal nanocomposite material used bone regeneration particularly craniomaxillofacial context,"['bone', 'important', 'structure', 'human', 'body', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'complex', 'trauma', 'pathological', 'situations', 'maxillofacial', 'tumors', 'produce', 'major', 'bone', 'defects', 'healed', 'physiological', 'processes', 'response', 'problem', 'many', 'strategies', 'studied', 'throughout', 'years', 'purpose', 'find', 'material', 'reunites', 'ideal', 'properties', 'regenerating', 'substituting', 'needed', 'bone', 'therefore', 'guarantee', 'physiological', 'structural', 'functions', 'among', 'strategies', 'transplantation', 'bone', 'within', 'individual', 'autografts', 'another', 'human', 'allograft', 'individual', 'another', 'species', 'xenograft', 'studied', 'clinically', 'applied', 'nowadays', 'however', 'techniques', 'revealed', 'drawbacks', 'donor', 'site', 'morbidity', 'risk', 'disease', 'infection', 'immunological', 'reactions', 'context', 'new', 'solutions', 'needed', 'field', 'biomaterials', 'nanocomposites', 'considered', 'promising', 'material', 'many', 'outcomes', 'mainly', 'allows', 'superior', 'structural', 'performance', 'compared', 'microcomposite', 'materials', 'bone', 'regeneration', 'area', 'ceramic', 'nanocomposites', 'dispersed', 'polymeric', 'matrix', 'promising', 'solution', 'reassemble', 'physiological', 'bone', 'structure', 'adding', 'unique', 'biocompatible', 'stimulating', 'properties', 'already', 'outstanding', 'mechanical', 'behavior', 'investigation', 'different', 'types', 'nanocomposites', 'well', 'added', 'enhance', 'biological', 'response', 'processing', 'ability', 'commercial', 'level', 'extremely', 'relevant', 'intends', 'present', 'review', 'published', 'information', 'vivo', 'vitro', 'studies', 'performed', 'last', 'years', 'contribution', 'development', 'ideal', 'nanocomposite', 'material', 'used', 'bone', 'regeneration', 'particularly', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'context']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
Application of LEAN Methodology to Support Projects Improvements in a Die Casting Industry,"The main goal of this project is to define waste, measure and eliminate it, inherent to the production of aluminium die casting parts on the company Schüle Druckguss in Germany. In order to eliminate waste, a set of improvement projects were carried out focusing on the production in the different halls of the company. For that purpose, Lean thinking and tools were used as supporting methodology. It is important to highlight that these projects include issues like the organization of the workplace, the optimization of the workload for the worker, programing transport routes and minimize inventory of raw material and finish goods. Towards to achieve the previous goals, it was necessary to observe operations and procedures, measure time, detect bottlenecks or critical tasks and test different scenarios, aiming to reduce the most wasteful activities. Referring to the workplace organization, the solution achieved consists on the application of a colored marking system on the floor to define the transport way and the place for the material. Regarding the workload of the worker, it was optimized given the worker, in the new procedure, more tasks, mostly due to the introduction of automation of controlling process. About the routes for the truck coming from the daughter company in Slovakia, it was changed and some wasteful activities reduced, obtaining a minimization of 15% of the time spent on these activities per day. Note that human and material resources were also saved with the new proposal. Furthermore, the necessary quantity of inventory referent to one product was calculated the economic quantity order and minimized costs in 34%. For the finish goods it was proposed a new layout for the boxes, in order to be transported more quantities, according with customers demand. Finally, it was studied a product and its variations, that is die casted on the daughter company in Slovakia and machined in Germany, in order to change its production to a continuous line in Germany. Thus, it was included on the Die Casting Island (DCI), three external processes, minimizing the time in transportation and using fewer workers than the actual situation. The current project is focused on continuous improvement, providing a low cost approach and performs the main goal which is to achieve the best practices within the organization.",2724234082,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Sousa, Liliana Marina Ferreira de",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

<b>Fenton’s Process Applied to Wastewaters Treatment</b>: Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Catalytic Operation Modes,"Water resources are not infinite. If even nowadays some people do not have proper access to this vital supply, humanity must do much more effort aiming its preservation in consideration with the future of the generations to come. Avoiding all types of pollutants from contaminating water cycles is currently one of the current utmost matters to be faced by government policies. Research on wastewaters treatment have been dealing this regard over many years now, strongly contributing with solutions to the related problems. The most frequently remediation techniques to several kinds of effluents are the biological treatments, where microorganisms consume the organic charge – thus requiring biomass adaptation when there are changes on substrates composition. Drawbacks emerge when non-biodegradable or toxic effluents must be dealt with. This, sometimes, makes it impossible to treat effluents by activated sludge, especially when the effluent is not available all over the year for bacteria to have time to get acclimated. Therefore, accordingly to the kind or content of the residues requiring remediation before discharge, different approaches may be considered instead. Portugal alone produced 80 kilotons of olive oil in 2012. In the same year, the World’s production exceeded 3.3 megatons, produced from fruits gathered from over 750 million trees spread all over the globe (most of it at the Mediterranean region). This elevated and concentrated production generates huge amounts of different effluents, summing up the so called olive mills wastewaters (OMW). These rejects simultaneously present the two imperative characteristics that renders biological option unsuccessful for environmental legislation achievement: toxicity to microorganisms (due to the presence of phenolic acids) and seasonality (since the crop of the fruits occur for approximately four months of the year). Consequently, it is necessary to find alternative treatments capable of abating these wastewaters’ organic charge at any period for as long as it is necessary. Solution circumventing the mentioned inconveniences are chemical treatment technologies, where the advanced oxidation technologies (AOPs) are included. These last are based on an oxidative reagent able to degrade the aimed compounds, either by complete elimination or by reducing their environmental harmfulness. Parameters such as chemical oxygen demands (COD), total organic carbon levels (TOC), total phenolic content (TPh), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), eco-toxicity (EC 20 and EC 50 ), amongst others, supply key information for these processes’ efficiency assessment, that may be presented as remediation alternatives after proper judgment of experimental results. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is a common reactant when it comes to wastewater oxidative treatments. Although it is a highly oxidative specie, further activation by cleavage into hydroxyl radicals (•OH) can be achieved by the presence of ozone, UV-light or transition metals. In particular, when this excitation is caused by iron ions (usually Fe 2+ ) it is called Fenton’s process, which has several industrial applications involving wastewater treatment with great economic advantages, especially for occurring under normal conditions of pressure and temperature. Besides, the non-selectivity of the Fenton’s radicals assures that several kinds of effluents can be oxidized by these systems.",2675220643,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Rossi, André Fernandes",,,

BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION DISRUPTORS: AN INVESTIGATION AT THE MILITARY STRATEGIC COMMAND LEVEL,"This paper will address business transformation disruption as a phenomena. The findings are based on a research study that was carried out utilizing a two-phase mixed-methods approach. The first phase included qualitative data gathering through a series of discussions and focus groups that provided an initial understanding of the phenomena and the basis needed to formulate the research conducted in the second phase. From this initia l phase, three main research categories were established: Leadership Turbulence, Resistance to Business Transformation , and Lack of Agility in Military Culture. For the purposes of this paper, however, the focus is on only one of three main categories (i.e., Leadership Turbulence) which was found to have a positive relationship associated with disruption of business transformation processes at the strategic command level within the U.S. military. Quantitative data collection and analysis were employed in the second phase to test the hypotheses. A total of 1,095 data points were collected from senior level military and civil servants of a U.S. Army strategic command organization (i.e., Training and Doctrine Command - TRADOC) using a self-administered online survey. The findings of this study highlight the importance of considering a wide range of critical success factors in the transformation of military strategic commands.

Military leader perceptions of sexual assaults against female service members,"The Department of Defense (DOD) Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Report on Sexual Assaults in the Military indicated sexual assaults on female service members have increased threefold since 2004 and spiked by 50% during the 2012–2013 reporting period. Not surprisingly, reducing military sexual assaults has become a major priority for the uniformed armed services. This study investigated military leader perceptions of the problem to understand better their leadership viewpoints and how these perceptions might be synthesized into a framework or plan of action for the military services to use to reduce sexual assaults on the military’s most vulnerable group (female service members under the age of 25). The study identified several high-impact root causes and causal factors associated with military sexual assaults against female service members. Root causes identified included insufficient protections and safeguards, sexual assault prevention and response training that does not sufficiently address perpetrator risk factors or alcohol-related factors, and insufficient focus on identification of prior perpetrators or males with high perpetrator risk factors. Causal factors identified included insufficient leadership/command climate/accountability, insufficient training specificity and emphasis, issues related to movement/red zone/male “center of the universe” behavior, a culture of alcohol misuse, and issues associated with lack of battle buddy/victim protections. The study concluded the military has not provided adequate victim protections or attempted to isolate service members with high perpetrator risk factors. The study also found that the military is promulgating doctrine that does not focus on the root causes and high-impact causal factors identified by this study.",1698494372,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Burns, Wallace A., Jr.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2014," Social sciences , Leader perceptions , Military sexual assaults , Root causes of sexual assaults", 978-1-321-84186-2,,, English, English,,,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/military-leader-perceptions-sexual-assaults/docview/1698494372/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Military+leader+perceptions+of+sexual+assaults+against+female+service+members&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Burns%2C+Wallace+A.%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=978-1-321-84186-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",fiscal year annual report sexual assault indicated sexual assault female service member increased threefold since spiked reporting period surprisingly reducing sexual assault become major priority uniformed armed service investigated leader perception problem understand better leadership viewpoint perception might synthesized framework plan action service use reduce sexual assault vulnerable group female service member age identified several root cause causal factor associated sexual assault female service member root cause identified included insufficient protection safeguard sexual assault prevention response training sufficiently address perpetrator risk factor factor insufficient focus identification prior perpetrator male high perpetrator risk factor causal factor identified included insufficient insufficient training specificity emphasis issue related center universe behavior culture alcohol misuse issue associated lack battle protection concluded provided adequate victim protection attempted isolate service member high perpetrator risk factor also found promulgating doctrine focus root cause causal factor identified,"['fiscal', 'year', 'annual', 'report', 'sexual', 'assaults', 'indicated', 'sexual', 'assaults', 'female', 'service', 'members', 'increased', 'threefold', 'since', 'spiked', 'reporting', 'period', 'surprisingly', 'reducing', 'sexual', 'assaults', 'become', 'major', 'priority', 'uniformed', 'armed', 'services', 'investigated', 'leader', 'perceptions', 'problem', 'understand', 'better', 'leadership', 'viewpoints', 'perceptions', 'might', 'synthesized', 'framework', 'plan', 'action', 'services', 'use', 'reduce', 'sexual', 'assaults', 'vulnerable', 'group', 'female', 'service', 'members', 'age', 'identified', 'several', 'root', 'causes', 'causal', 'factors', 'associated', 'sexual', 'assaults', 'female', 'service', 'members', 'root', 'causes', 'identified', 'included', 'insufficient', 'protections', 'safeguards', 'sexual', 'assault', 'prevention', 'response', 'training', 'sufficiently', 'address', 'perpetrator', 'risk', 'factors', 'factors', 'insufficient', 'focus', 'identification', 'prior', 'perpetrators', 'males', 'high', 'perpetrator', 'risk', 'factors', 'causal', 'factors', 'identified', 'included', 'insufficient', 'insufficient', 'training', 'specificity', 'emphasis', 'issues', 'related', 'center', 'universe', 'behavior', 'culture', 'alcohol', 'misuse', 'issues', 'associated', 'lack', 'battle', 'protections', 'concluded', 'provided', 'adequate', 'victim', 'protections', 'attempted', 'isolate', 'service', 'members', 'high', 'perpetrator', 'risk', 'factors', 'also', 'found', 'promulgating', 'doctrine', 'focus', 'root', 'causes', 'causal', 'factors', 'identified']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership

SOAR stands for strengths, opportunities, aspirations, and results. The mixed methods research design employed the qualitative research approach of grounded theory as the primary research method. Quantitative data from the SOAR Profile were used to support the qualitative findings. The study was conducted using 16 in-depth qualitative interviews with leaders in the U.S. Army who are graduates of the U.S. Army's Senior Service College Fellowship (SSCF) program. The results of the study created The Organizational Collective Motivation (OCM) Framework. This framework shows the meaning of OCM, how elements of OCM are developed, and how SOAR builds OCM during organizational transformation. OCM was found to be a distinct and separate motivational construct that exists in all levels of the organization and is based on individual and collective beliefs. OCM develops from both individual and collective motivational aspects that emerge as individuals and the collective work towards organizational goals. OCM develops from 19 motivating elements which are common to individual and collective motivational aspects. Finally, individual and collective aspects are influenced by organizational, job, and leadership aspects. The framework suggests that developing OCM in an organization drives all members to be motivated to contribute to achieve organizational goals. The framework also suggests that during organizational transformation the use of SOAR will build OCM elements of commitment and beliefs. The propositions that emerged from this study provide the meaning of OCM, the elements of OCM, and how to build OCM. The 10 propositions support the findings and provide opportunities for future work in the research area of OCM.",1658214608,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Hitchcock, Jennifer Ann",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2014," Social sciences , Collective motivation , Organization development , Organizational behavior , Organizational collective motivation , Organizational transformation , Soar", 978-1-321-56792-2,,, English, English,,,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploration-organizational-collective-motivation/docview/1658214608/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+Exploration+of+Organizational+Collective+Motivation+and+the+Influence+of+the+SOAR+Framework+to+Build+Organizational+Collective+Motivation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hitchcock%2C+Jennifer+Ann&amp;isbn=978-1-321-56792-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,mixed method explored meaning organizational collective motivation ocm discovered element develop ocm determined soar framework build element ocm organizational transformation soar stand strength opportunity aspiration result mixed method design employed qualitative grounded theory primary quantitative soar profile used support qualitative finding conducted using qualitative interview leader army graduate army senior service college fellowship sscf program result created organizational collective motivation ocm framework framework show meaning ocm element ocm developed soar build ocm organizational transformation ocm found distinct separate motivational construct exists level organization based individual collective belief ocm develops individual collective motivational aspect emerge individual collective work towards organizational goal ocm develops motivating element common individual collective motivational aspect finally individual collective aspect influenced organizational job leadership aspect framework suggests developing ocm organization drive member motivated contribute achieve organizational goal framework also suggests organizational transformation use soar build ocm element commitment belief proposition emerged provide meaning ocm element ocm build ocm proposition support finding provide opportunity future work area ocm,"['mixed', 'methods', 'explored', 'meaning', 'organizational', 'collective', 'motivation', 'ocm', 'discovered', 'elements', 'develop', 'ocm', 'determined', 'soar', 'framework', 'builds', 'elements', 'ocm', 'organizational', 'transformation', 'soar', 'stands', 'strengths', 'opportunities', 'aspirations', 'results', 'mixed', 'methods', 'design', 'employed', 'qualitative', 'grounded', 'theory', 'primary', 'quantitative', 'data', 'soar', 'profile', 'used', 'support', 'qualitative', 'findings', 'conducted', 'using', 'qualitative', 'interviews', 'leaders', 'army', 'graduates', 'army', 'senior', 'service', 'college', 'fellowship', 'sscf', 'program', 'results', 'created', 'organizational', 'collective', 'motivation', 'ocm', 'framework', 'framework', 'shows', 'meaning', 'ocm', 'elements', 'ocm', 'developed', 'soar', 'builds', 'ocm', 'organizational', 'transformation', 'ocm', 'found', 'distinct', 'separate', 'motivational', 'construct', 'exists', 'levels', 'organization', 'based', 'individual', 'collective', 'beliefs', 'ocm', 'develops', 'individual', 'collective', 'motivational', 'aspects', 'emerge', 'individuals', 'collective', 'work', 'towards', 'organizational', 'goals', 'ocm', 'develops', 'motivating', 'elements', 'common', 'individual', 'collective', 'motivational', 'aspects', 'finally', 'individual', 'collective', 'aspects', 'influenced', 'organizational', 'job', 'leadership', 'aspects', 'framework', 'suggests', 'developing', 'ocm', 'organization', 'drives', 'members', 'motivated', 'contribute', 'achieve', 'organizational', 'goals', 'framework', 'also', 'suggests', 'organizational', 'transformation', 'use', 'soar', 'build', 'ocm', 'elements', 'commitment', 'beliefs', 'propositions', 'emerged', 'provide', 'meaning', 'ocm', 'elements', 'ocm', 'build', 'ocm', 'propositions', 'support', 'findings', 'provide', 'opportunities', 'future', 'work', 'area', 'ocm']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Dynamic Guidelines to Statistically Control Peer Review Costs,"During the system/software development lifecycle process (SDLC), peer reviews are conducted throughout to ensure that true-positive defects are detected and flagged for re-work. Often, false-positive defects may be flagged for re-work as well, thus increasing operational costs. This paper examines two possible organizational baseline and operational scenarios sequence recommendations using statistical process control of peer review costs. The optimal organizational operational scenario will be selected based on the analysis of over four years of empirical data and 2517 data points collected during the time of the research. The conclusions will show that the log-transformed data scenario is the best, most optimal, operational scenario to implement within the organization. Although the research was sponsored by a Department of Defense prime contractor to the U.S. Air Force bound software systems, it can be applied in the civilian sector of aviation transportation software systems in the management of the supply chain. Identifying accurate defects and implementing this scientifically proven method of controlling costs within the organization is of tremendous value in both government and civilian aviation transportation systems.",1622312253,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Koursaris, Constantine M, PhD;Welch, Richard L W, PhD",,, Copyright Institute of Industrial Engineers-Publisher 2014,,, Feature,, 2014," Software development , Software system , Systems management , Statistical process control , Peer review",,,, English, English,, 4114-4123, Norcross,2014,IISE Annual Conference.

Making Program/Budget Decisions about the Future of the Navy: How Senior Flag Officers Work with Political Appointees and Career Civilian Executives inside the Navy Headquarters,"Today's Navy is the product of the myriad decisions made over the last fifty years by leaders inside the Navy headquarters, the Pentagon, White House and the Congress. Over the last quarter of a century the number of combatant ships in the US Navy has declined and the cost of buying and operating them has nearly doubled in inflation adjusted dollars. This result has occurred even though no Navy official has ever expressed a desire for this particular outcome. The purpose of this study was to learn whether this outcome could be explained by understanding the ways that the senior leaders in the Navy headquarters interact and participate in the Programming, Planning, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES). To conduct this qualitative research project I collected data directly from key participants in the PPBES through twenty-five semi-structured interviews where I posed a series of open-ended questions to Navy and Department of Defense officials who worked in the Pentagon at some point during the last quarter century. I also collected data from a panel discussion with fourteen senior defense experts (four of whom I also interviewed later) and through a review of Congressional testimony by senior Department of the Navy (DON) officials presented between 1989 and 2013. In addition to qualitative data I compiled a comprehensive database of program/budget information for the twenty-five year period between FY 1989 and FY 2014 that captured the total costs of the Navy, the size of the combatant fleet and all of the issues raised by analysts inside the Navy headquarters and adjudicated during the annual DON and DoD PPBES processes. This research adds to the base of knowledge by collecting unique insights into how flag officers, political appointees and members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) interact behind the scenes to make program and budget decisions about the future of the Navy.",1618951134,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Farley, Robin Lee",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2014," Social sciences , Admirals , Budget , Decision-making , Grounded-theory , Interviews , Navy", 978-1-321-21682-0,,, English, English,,,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/making-program-budget-decisions-about-future-navy/docview/1618951134/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Making+Program%2FBudget+Decisions+about+the+Future+of+the+Navy%3A+How+Senior+Flag+Officers+Work+with+Political+Appointees+and+Career+Civilian+Executives+inside+the+Navy+Headquarters&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Farley%2C+Robin+Lee&amp;isbn=978-1-321-21682-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",today navy product myriad decision made last fifty year leader inside navy headquarters pentagon white house congress last quarter century number combatant ship navy declined cost buying operating nearly doubled inflation adjusted dollar occurred even though navy official ever expressed desire particular outcome purpose learn whether outcome could explained understanding way senior leader navy headquarters interact participate programming planning budgeting execution system ppbes conduct qualitative project collected directly key participant ppbes interview posed series question navy official worked pentagon point last quarter century also collected panel discussion fourteen senior expert four also interviewed later review congressional testimony senior navy official presented addition qualitative compiled comprehensive database information year period captured total cost navy size combatant fleet issue raised analyst inside navy headquarters adjudicated annual ppbes process add base knowledge collecting unique insight flag officer political appointee member senior executive service s interact behind scene make program budget decision future navy,"['today', 'navy', 'product', 'myriad', 'decisions', 'made', 'last', 'fifty', 'years', 'leaders', 'inside', 'navy', 'headquarters', 'pentagon', 'white', 'house', 'congress', 'last', 'quarter', 'century', 'number', 'combatant', 'ships', 'navy', 'declined', 'cost', 'buying', 'operating', 'nearly', 'doubled', 'inflation', 'adjusted', 'dollars', 'result', 'occurred', 'even', 'though', 'navy', 'official', 'ever', 'expressed', 'desire', 'particular', 'outcome', 'purpose', 'learn', 'whether', 'outcome', 'could', 'explained', 'understanding', 'ways', 'senior', 'leaders', 'navy', 'headquarters', 'interact', 'participate', 'programming', 'planning', 'budgeting', 'execution', 'system', 'ppbes', 'conduct', 'qualitative', 'project', 'collected', 'data', 'directly', 'key', 'participants', 'ppbes', 'interviews', 'posed', 'series', 'questions', 'navy', 'officials', 'worked', 'pentagon', 'point', 'last', 'quarter', 'century', 'also', 'collected', 'data', 'panel', 'discussion', 'fourteen', 'senior', 'experts', 'four', 'also', 'interviewed', 'later', 'review', 'congressional', 'testimony', 'senior', 'navy', 'officials', 'presented', 'addition', 'qualitative', 'data', 'compiled', 'comprehensive', 'database', 'information', 'year', 'period', 'captured', 'total', 'costs', 'navy', 'size', 'combatant', 'fleet', 'issues', 'raised', 'analysts', 'inside', 'navy', 'headquarters', 'adjudicated', 'annual', 'ppbes', 'processes', 'adds', 'base', 'knowledge', 'collecting', 'unique', 'insights', 'flag', 'officers', 'political', 'appointees', 'members', 'senior', 'executive', 'service', 'ses', 'interact', 'behind', 'scenes', 'make', 'program', 'budget', 'decisions', 'future', 'navy']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
An Evaluation of Organizational Change and Lean Six Sigma in Federal Government,"In 2004, U.S. Army leadership executed a strategy to employ Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodologies to respond to the need for more efficient and effective business processes and develop a cost-conscious culture. The research problem indicated the need for an objective evaluation of the effectiveness of LSS in changing the culture of a government organization. The purpose of this mixed method explanatory case study was to understand the effectiveness of the LSS training program in changing a government organizational culture and performance. The research questions were appropriate for evaluating program effectiveness using a 5-level return on investment (ROI) framework. The theoretical framework included sociotechnical and organizational change theory. An organization of approximately 470 employees served as the population for this study. Purposive sampling served as the data collection methodology. Quantitative data consisted of pre-and post-test scores, questionnaires, and archived and training data. Qualitative data consisted of LSS practical exercise photographs. Data analysis included pattern matching, inferential, and descriptive statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics illustrated differences in test scores, survey responses, photographic data, improvement targets, ROI, and organizational performance. A paired t test determined a significant difference between pre- and posttests scores. A 1-sample sign test and a time-series analysis indicated a significant change in organizational performance. Data triangulation validated that the drivers of change were policy, leadership, and the LSS training program. Government personnel, change agents, and researchers may benefit from this research by employing the drivers of change in planning or implementing change, improving the status quo, or conducting research.",1610820790,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Johnson, Wava Tyrone",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2014," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Federal government , Leadership , Lean six sigma , Organizational change , Return on investment , Sociotechnical", 978-1-321-13010-2,,, English, English,,,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/evaluation-organizational-change-lean-six-sigma/docview/1610820790/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+Evaluation+of+Organizational+Change+and+Lean+Six+Sigma+in+Federal+Government&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+Wava+Tyrone&amp;isbn=978-1-321-13010-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,army leadership executed strategy employ lean six sigma lss methodology respond need efficient effective business process develop culture problem indicated need objective evaluation effectiveness lss changing culture government organization purpose mixed explanatory case understand effectiveness lss training program changing government organizational culture performance question appropriate evaluating program effectiveness using return investment roi framework theoretical framework included sociotechnical organizational change theory organization approximately employee served population purposive sampling served collection quantitative consisted score questionnaire archived training qualitative consisted lss practical exercise photograph included pattern matching inferential descriptive statistical descriptive statistic illustrated difference test score survey response photographic improvement target roi organizational performance paired test determined significant difference posttests score sign test indicated significant change organizational performance triangulation validated driver change policy leadership lss training program government personnel change agent researcher may benefit employing driver change planning implementing change improving status quo conducting,"['army', 'leadership', 'executed', 'strategy', 'employ', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'lss', 'methodologies', 'respond', 'need', 'efficient', 'effective', 'business', 'processes', 'develop', 'culture', 'problem', 'indicated', 'need', 'objective', 'evaluation', 'effectiveness', 'lss', 'changing', 'culture', 'government', 'organization', 'purpose', 'mixed', 'explanatory', 'case', 'understand', 'effectiveness', 'lss', 'training', 'program', 'changing', 'government', 'organizational', 'culture', 'performance', 'questions', 'appropriate', 'evaluating', 'program', 'effectiveness', 'using', 'return', 'investment', 'roi', 'framework', 'theoretical', 'framework', 'included', 'sociotechnical', 'organizational', 'change', 'theory', 'organization', 'approximately', 'employees', 'served', 'population', 'purposive', 'sampling', 'served', 'data', 'collection', 'quantitative', 'data', 'consisted', 'scores', 'questionnaires', 'archived', 'training', 'data', 'qualitative', 'data', 'consisted', 'lss', 'practical', 'exercise', 'photographs', 'data', 'included', 'pattern', 'matching', 'inferential', 'descriptive', 'statistical', 'descriptive', 'statistics', 'illustrated', 'differences', 'test', 'scores', 'survey', 'responses', 'photographic', 'data', 'improvement', 'targets', 'roi', 'organizational', 'performance', 'paired', 'test', 'determined', 'significant', 'difference', 'posttests', 'scores', 'sign', 'test', 'indicated', 'significant', 'change', 'organizational', 'performance', 'data', 'triangulation', 'validated', 'drivers', 'change', 'policy', 'leadership', 'lss', 'training', 'program', 'government', 'personnel', 'change', 'agents', 'researchers', 'may', 'benefit', 'employing', 'drivers', 'change', 'planning', 'implementing', 'change', 'improving', 'status', 'quo', 'conducting']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
"Asset turn-in Lean Six Sigma project for White Sands Test Center, Department of the Army","The White Sands Test Center, located on White Sands Missile Range in Southern New Mexico, conducts numerous missions in support of the Army and other Department of Defense customers. Performing these missions requires an enormous amount of non-expendable equipment that has to be accounted for through a hand receipt process. Over the years, much of this equipment had become obsolete or unserviceable but had not been turned in for proper supply management. Consequently, the amount of equipment on hand was not effectively documented or tracked. This project used the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) process to improve asset accountability. The process of turning in excess equipment was evaluated. The project included personnel from the White Sands Test Center and the Directorate of Logistics. The project increased the number of turn-in items by 90% and the Sigma Quality Level (SQL) of the process was increased from 1.5 to 1.773.",1585893078,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Costa, Karen Marie",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2014," Applied sciences , Lean Six Sigma", 978-1-321-25396-2,,, English, English,,,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/asset-turn-lean-six-sigma-project-white-sands/docview/1585893078/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Asset+turn-in+Lean+Six+Sigma+project+for+White+Sands+Test+Center%2C+Department+of+the+Army&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Costa%2C+Karen+Marie&amp;isbn=978-1-321-25396-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,white sand test center located white sand missile range southern new mexico conduct numerous mission support army customer performing mission requires enormous amount equipment accounted hand receipt process year much equipment become obsolete unserviceable turned proper supply management consequently amount equipment hand effectively documented tracked project used lean six sigma lss dmaic process improve asset accountability process turning excess equipment evaluated project included personnel white sand test center directorate logistics project increased number item sigma quality level sql process increased,"['white', 'sands', 'test', 'center', 'located', 'white', 'sands', 'missile', 'range', 'southern', 'new', 'mexico', 'conducts', 'numerous', 'missions', 'support', 'army', 'customers', 'performing', 'missions', 'requires', 'enormous', 'amount', 'equipment', 'accounted', 'hand', 'receipt', 'process', 'years', 'much', 'equipment', 'become', 'obsolete', 'unserviceable', 'turned', 'proper', 'supply', 'management', 'consequently', 'amount', 'equipment', 'hand', 'effectively', 'documented', 'tracked', 'project', 'used', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'lss', 'dmaic', 'process', 'improve', 'asset', 'accountability', 'process', 'turning', 'excess', 'equipment', 'evaluated', 'project', 'included', 'personnel', 'white', 'sands', 'test', 'center', 'directorate', 'logistics', 'project', 'increased', 'number', 'items', 'sigma', 'quality', 'level', 'sql', 'process', 'increased']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement

An examination of the effects of incrementalism and annuality in U.S. government budgeting practices,"Agency theory predicts that agents will act in their own self-interest when there is a misalignment between the principal's and agent's goals. Congressional budgeting controls rely on annuality and incrementalism to direct agency spending behaviors. Annuality requires agencies to obligate funds the same year that congress authorizes them, which encourages government leaders to spend all appropriated dollars to avoid returning the money. Incrementalism is the process of making small incremental budget changes from year to year, which may further encourage government leaders to spend appropriated dollars to avoid budget reductions in future. The purpose of this quasi-experimental quantitative research was to compare the spending patterns of government agencies with non-government organizations to determine if government budgeting controls encourage inefficient spending and a principal-agent misalignment. Quarterly spending data were collected from archived historical financial statements of government and non-government organizations in the defense industry during the years 2006 through 2012. The sample consisted of the three largest government organizations and the six largest non-government organizations in the defense industry. Independent-groups t-tests were conducted to analyze quarterly spending patterns of both groups of organizations. The spending variances between the first-quarter and second-quarter were not significantly different between government and non-government defense organizations, t(20)=-.56, p=.584. However, there were significant differences between the third-quarter variances, t(21)=-4.48, p=.000, and the fourth-quarter variances, t(61)=5.61, p=.000, for government and non-government defense organizations. The outcomes were consistent with agency theory predictions related to annuality and incrementalism. The results are limited to the DOD agencies and cannot be attributed to the entire population of government organizations without further research. The study is significant as the results indicate that changes to government budgeting practices are necessary.

Female officers who achieved general officer status in the u.s. army: A multiple-case study of motivation and success strategies,"The problem of declining female general officer numbers adds to the lack of female role models and female mentors at the senior levels of the Army. Several scholarly articles have been written about the motivation and success strategies of women in various professions, but few have focused on female officers who achieved general officer status in the U.S. Army. The purpose of this study was to contribute to the knowledge base of scholars to better understand motivation and success strategies from the perspective of female U.S. Army general officers by filling that gap in the scholarly literature. The research question for this qualitative multiple-case study was What can be learned from a study of the motivation and success strategies used by female officers who achieved general officer status in the U.S. Army? The researcher purposefully selected participants who were identified as female, general officer, in the U.S. Army, and retired. The findings revealed that most of the female generals motivated by adventure and travel were the first to command or serve in operational assignments and were proficient at their craft despite isolation and sexual harassment. Few women preceded these women in the military who took the hard, aggressive leadership positions that made them competitive with their male peers as a success strategy. For second lieutenant up to colonel, promotion board members must vote based only on the officer's promotion file and cannot discuss the files or the officers being considered for promotion. For officer promotions to brigadier general and major general, promotion board members vote based on the promotion file and discussion about the officers being considered for promotion. Board members may be advocates, or speak on behalf of advocates, for officers being considered for promotion by the board in order to sway board votes. Further study into strategies of acquiring and then succeeding in high-risk assignments and making those feats known to senior leaders would benefit Army officers.",1527094371,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Dougherty, Judy S.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2014," Social sciences , Gender , Leadership , Military , Motivation , Strategies , Success", 978-1-303-84274-0,,, English, English,,,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/female-officers-who-achieved-general-officer/docview/1527094371/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Female+officers+who+achieved+general+officer+status+in+the+u.s.+army%3A+A+multiple-case+study+of+motivation+and+success+strategies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dougherty%2C+Judy+S.&amp;isbn=978-1-303-84274-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch Collection, Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",problem declining female general officer number add lack female role model female mentor senior level army several scholarly article written motivation success strategy woman various profession focused female officer achieved general officer status army purpose contribute knowledge base scholar better understand motivation success strategy perspective female army general officer filling gap scholarly literature question qualitative learned motivation success strategy used female officer achieved general officer status army researcher purposefully selected participant identified female general officer army retired finding revealed female general motivated adventure travel first command serve operational assignment proficient craft despite isolation sexual harassment woman preceded woman took hard aggressive leadership position made competitive male peer success strategy second lieutenant colonel promotion board member must vote based officer promotion file discus file officer considered promotion officer promotion brigadier general major general promotion board member vote based promotion file discussion officer considered promotion board member may advocate speak behalf advocate officer considered promotion board order sway board vote strategy acquiring succeeding assignment making feat known senior leader would benefit army officer,"['problem', 'declining', 'female', 'general', 'officer', 'numbers', 'adds', 'lack', 'female', 'role', 'models', 'female', 'mentors', 'senior', 'levels', 'army', 'several', 'scholarly', 'articles', 'written', 'motivation', 'success', 'strategies', 'women', 'various', 'professions', 'focused', 'female', 'officers', 'achieved', 'general', 'officer', 'status', 'army', 'purpose', 'contribute', 'knowledge', 'base', 'scholars', 'better', 'understand', 'motivation', 'success', 'strategies', 'perspective', 'female', 'army', 'general', 'officers', 'filling', 'gap', 'scholarly', 'literature', 'question', 'qualitative', 'learned', 'motivation', 'success', 'strategies', 'used', 'female', 'officers', 'achieved', 'general', 'officer', 'status', 'army', 'researcher', 'purposefully', 'selected', 'participants', 'identified', 'female', 'general', 'officer', 'army', 'retired', 'findings', 'revealed', 'female', 'generals', 'motivated', 'adventure', 'travel', 'first', 'command', 'serve', 'operational', 'assignments', 'proficient', 'craft', 'despite', 'isolation', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'women', 'preceded', 'women', 'took', 'hard', 'aggressive', 'leadership', 'positions', 'made', 'competitive', 'male', 'peers', 'success', 'strategy', 'second', 'lieutenant', 'colonel', 'promotion', 'board', 'members', 'must', 'vote', 'based', 'officer', 'promotion', 'file', 'discuss', 'files', 'officers', 'considered', 'promotion', 'officer', 'promotions', 'brigadier', 'general', 'major', 'general', 'promotion', 'board', 'members', 'vote', 'based', 'promotion', 'file', 'discussion', 'officers', 'considered', 'promotion', 'board', 'members', 'may', 'advocates', 'speak', 'behalf', 'advocates', 'officers', 'considered', 'promotion', 'board', 'order', 'sway', 'board', 'votes', 'strategies', 'acquiring', 'succeeding', 'assignments', 'making', 'feats', 'known', 'senior', 'leaders', 'would', 'benefit', 'army', 'officers']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Wheel of innovation: How leaders' attitudes and behaviors drive disruptive technology in the U.S. Navy,"Problem and Purpose Innovative solutions in national defense are needed to respond to national security threats in our uncertain environment. Leader attitudes and behaviors have a substantial impact on innovation. Unfortunately we did not completely understand the effect of leader attitudes and behaviors on innovation and the team dynamics that lead to innovation, especially in the military. The purpose of this study was to determine how leadership attitudes and behaviors contribute to product innovation within the U.S. Navy and how leadership emerges within this complex adaptive system of innovation. Method The research was a qualitative design based on a multiple or comparative case study. A theoretical/conceptual framework of complexity leadership theory was used as a meso model to understand adaptive innovative processes at work in the context of bureaucratic forms of organizing. Three teams based on three product innovations were selected because they demonstrated breakthrough innovation with disruptive technology and successfully fielded their capabilities within cost and schedule thresholds. Data from three project teams were collected using interviews, focus groups, and program documentation. Eighteen individuals participated in interviews and focus groups. The attitudes and behaviors of nine formal leaders and several emerging leaders were analyzed and evaluated. The results were summarized in six different themes that were apparent across all three projects and multiple leaders. Results These six themes were a combination of leader attitudes and behaviors that contributed to the success of the three projects. These attitudes and behaviors were observed at all levels of the organization from the program manager, to the IPT leaders, to the engineers getting the job done. The first theme was urgency driven by a heartfelt need. The second theme was that these leaders would listen and were open to ideas. The third theme was to know the process and challenge the process while managing risk and ensuring it is good enough. The fourth theme was vision, passion, assertive, persistence, and moderating setbacks. The fifth theme was trusted leader with credibility, integrity, and was professional. The last theme was collaboration, teamwork, and recognition. Communication was apparent throughout all the themes and links them together. Conclusions The attitudes and behaviors of the leaders in this study contributed to the innovation by keeping the polarity within these themes in creative tension. The leaders established a strong sense of urgency based on a heartfelt need while also creating an atmosphere and practice of making sure everyone had a voice and their voice counted. The leaders were professional with credibility and integrity. They knew the process, but also challenged the process, managed risk, and encouraged a solution that was good enough. The leaders were passionate about the vision and were assertive and persistent in removing obstacles. But they also encouraged collaboration and teamwork. They moderated setbacks and prevented the team from getting discouraged and took opportunities to recognize the team both informally and formally. These leader attitudes and behaviors contributed toward leaders emerging in the organization. A wheel of innovation is proposed that demonstrates the themes in a synergistic and balanced approach. While this improved our understanding of how leader attitudes and behaviors drive innovation, there are still significant areas for further study. Further case studies are needed to determine if this wheel of innovation is applicable outside of the U.S. Navy. Quantitative studies based on these findings are needed to expand the understanding and generalizability of the model.",1524723467,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Witzel, Eddy Wayne",,, Database copyright

Sailing on a Sea of Hope: Exploring the Impact of Federal Consolidation on Individual Identification and Organizational Identity,"Organizational consolidation and restructuring is a long held public sector quick-fix solution to issues of limited congressional funding, ineffective structure, and/or the presumption of hierarchical failures of leadership, in hope of improving organizational performance. Such attempts at federal government reorganization are often criticized in terms of dollars and sense —attempting to save dollars, but not making much sense. While a plethora of literature exists on private sector reorganization (i.e., merger and acquisition) and their workforce, there is scarce research available on similar events for the public sector. This case study sought to understand the impact of mandated federal consolidation on the public sector workforce. Leveraging Cheney's (1983) and Bergami and Bagazzi's (2000) theories and studies on organizational identification, the second order effect on identity and identification for the associated federal workforce was revealed as having significant negative impact—worthy of immediate leadership attention and future study. A key conclusion of this study provided insight into public sector individual identification as grounded in differing psychological contracts dependent on status (military versus civil service), but revealed a shared an incremental hierarchical default to patriotism as the final vestige for rationalizing identification. Recommendations are offered for future public sector studies as a dichotomous evaluation of military versus civil service, expanding literature beyond the private sector, and offering practical insight for the world's largest employer, the Department of Defense, with likely benefit for the workforce and the taxpayer. The question remains whether the study leadership will leverage these lessons learned or just continue their journey sailing on a sea of hope .",1524256269,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Moreau, Eastine Louise",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2014," Social sciences , Case study , Interviews , Surveys & questionnaires , Qualitative research , Focus groups , Indifference , Individual identification , Organizational change , Organizational identity , Patriotism , Psychological contract", 978-1-303-81000-8,,, English, English,,,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/sailing-on-sea-hope-exploring-impact-federal/docview/1524256269/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sailing+on+a+Sea+of+Hope%3A+Exploring+the+Impact+of+Federal+Consolidation+on+Individual+Identification+and+Organizational+Identity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moreau%2C+Eastine+Louise&amp;isbn=978-1-303-81000-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,organizational consolidation restructuring long held public sector solution issue limited congressional funding ineffective structure presumption hierarchical failure leadership hope improving organizational performance attempt federal government reorganization often criticized term dollar sense save dollar making much sense plethora literature exists private sector reorganization merger acquisition workforce scarce available similar event public sector case sought understand impact mandated federal consolidation public sector workforce leveraging cheney bergami bagazzi theory study organizational identification second order effect identity identification associated federal workforce revealed significant negative immediate leadership attention future key conclusion provided insight public sector individual identification grounded differing psychological contract dependent status versus civil service revealed shared incremental hierarchical default patriotism final vestige rationalizing identification recommendation offered future public sector study dichotomous evaluation versus civil service expanding literature beyond private sector offering practical insight world largest employer likely benefit workforce taxpayer question remains whether leadership leverage lesson learned continue journey sailing sea hope,"['organizational', 'consolidation', 'restructuring', 'long', 'held', 'public', 'sector', 'solution', 'issues', 'limited', 'congressional', 'funding', 'ineffective', 'structure', 'presumption', 'hierarchical', 'failures', 'leadership', 'hope', 'improving', 'organizational', 'performance', 'attempts', 'federal', 'government', 'reorganization', 'often', 'criticized', 'terms', 'dollars', 'sense', 'save', 'dollars', 'making', 'much', 'sense', 'plethora', 'literature', 'exists', 'private', 'sector', 'reorganization', 'merger', 'acquisition', 'workforce', 'scarce', 'available', 'similar', 'events', 'public', 'sector', 'case', 'sought', 'understand', 'impact', 'mandated', 'federal', 'consolidation', 'public', 'sector', 'workforce', 'leveraging', 'cheney', 'bergami', 'bagazzi', 'theories', 'studies', 'organizational', 'identification', 'second', 'order', 'effect', 'identity', 'identification', 'associated', 'federal', 'workforce', 'revealed', 'significant', 'negative', 'immediate', 'leadership', 'attention', 'future', 'key', 'conclusion', 'provided', 'insight', 'public', 'sector', 'individual', 'identification', 'grounded', 'differing', 'psychological', 'contracts', 'dependent', 'status', 'versus', 'civil', 'service', 'revealed', 'shared', 'incremental', 'hierarchical', 'default', 'patriotism', 'final', 'vestige', 'rationalizing', 'identification', 'recommendations', 'offered', 'future', 'public', 'sector', 'studies', 'dichotomous', 'evaluation', 'versus', 'civil', 'service', 'expanding', 'literature', 'beyond', 'private', 'sector', 'offering', 'practical', 'insight', 'world', 'largest', 'employer', 'likely', 'benefit', 'workforce', 'taxpayer', 'question', 'remains', 'whether', 'leadership', 'leverage', 'lessons', 'learned', 'continue', 'journey', 'sailing', 'sea', 'hope']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
An investigation of business transformation disruptors at the military strategic command level,"This dissertation contributes an empirical research on business transformation disruption in the military. Specifically, this exploratory research seeks a better understanding of disruption of business transformation and some of the factors that are likely to impact the transformation process at the military strategic command level. A lack of empirical studies existing in the literature, coupled with the continuous transformation challenges faced by military organizations, make it necessary to conduct this empirical study of business transformation disruption in the military. This research was carried out utilizing a two-phase mixed-methods approach. The first phase included qualitative data gathering through a series of discussions and focus groups that provided an initial understanding of the phenomena and the basis needed to formulate the research conducted in the second phase. From this initial phase, three main research categories were established which focused on Leadership Turbulence, Resistance to Business Transformation, and Lack of Agility in Military Culture. A quantitative data collection and analysis was conducted in the second phase to test a set of seven hypotheses. A total of 1,095 data points were collected from senior level military and civil servants of a U.S. Army strategic command organization (Training and Doctrine Command) using a self-administered online survey. The results of this investigation suggest that a) frequent turnover of a commander or commanding general, b) perceived inconsistencies of leadership guidance, and c) perceived disincentives for achieving organizational process efficiencies are associated to disrupting business transformation goals and initiatives. Conversely, this initial investigation failed to support that d) collaboration with colleagues, e) reluctance to adopting different business processes, f) perceived negative assessments of process improvement initiatives, and g) dissent tolerance are associated to the disruption of business transformation efforts at the military strategic command level.

The Effectiveness of Soldier Medical Readiness Councils in Reducing and Shaping the Population of Soldiers Not Medically Deployable,"The population of Soldiers not medically fit for deployment has created readiness problems for the U.S. Army in recent years. To address this issue, the 3rd Infantry Division created councils of experts to address the size of its medically nondeployable population. Our results demonstrate success in effectively reducing the subpopulation of Soldiers who have been medically nondeployable for long periods of time by enforcing their return to duty or medical retirement. This study also demonstrates that council-based management affects the composition of the medically-not-ready population. Traditional approaches allow a minority subpopulation of Soldiers with poor prognoses to dwell within the nondeployable population for long periods of time (6-18+ months), whereas the healthier majority recovers within the first 6 months. This creates a dynamic in which remaining in the population for longer time periods increases the probability of being medically retired. Our study demonstrates that councils consistently and actively shape the character of the group such that those remaining in the medically-not-ready population for longer periods of time do not have an increased risk of medical retirement. Soldier Medical Readiness Councils have already been adopted by the Army. This article provides evidence to support their efficacy.",1418694562, 23820343,,Scholarly Journals,,"Malish, Richard G, MC USA;Maxwell, Gail L, SP USA;Arnett, Anthony D, MC USA;Cassidy, Jessica M, AN USA;Place, Ronald J, MC USA",, Department of the Army, Copyright Association of Military Surgeons of the United States Jul 2013,,," General Information , Journal Article",, Jul 2013," Veteran , Soldier",,0026-4075,7.0, English, English,, 715-21, Oxford,Jul 2013,Military Medicine,2013,,178.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/effectiveness-soldier-medical-readiness-councils/docview/1418694562/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahealthcompleteshell&amp;atitle=The+Effectiveness+of+Soldier+Medical+Readiness+Councils+in+Reducing+and+Shaping+the+Population+of+Soldiers+Not+Medically+Deployable&amp;title=Military+Medicine&amp;issn=00264075&amp;date=2013-07-01&amp;volume=178&amp;issue=7&amp;spage=715&amp;au=Malish%2C+Richard+G%2C+MC+USA%3BMaxwell%2C+Gail+L%2C+SP+USA%3BArnett%2C+Anthony+D%2C+MC+USA%3BCassidy%2C+Jessica+M%2C+AN+USA%3BPlace%2C+Ronald+J%2C+MC+USA&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Military+Medicine&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/23820343&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Health Research Premium Collection, Military Database, ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",population soldier medically fit deployment created readiness problem army recent year address issue infantry division created council expert address size medically nondeployable population result demonstrate success effectively reducing subpopulation soldier medically nondeployable long period time enforcing return duty medical retirement also demonstrates management affect composition population traditional approach allow minority subpopulation soldier poor prognosis dwell within nondeployable population long period time month whereas healthier majority recovers within first month creates dynamic remaining population longer time period increase probability medically retired demonstrates council consistently actively shape character group remaining population longer period time increased risk medical retirement soldier medical readiness council already adopted army article provides evidence support efficacy,"['population', 'soldiers', 'medically', 'fit', 'deployment', 'created', 'readiness', 'problems', 'army', 'recent', 'years', 'address', 'issue', 'infantry', 'division', 'created', 'councils', 'experts', 'address', 'size', 'medically', 'nondeployable', 'population', 'results', 'demonstrate', 'success', 'effectively', 'reducing', 'subpopulation', 'soldiers', 'medically', 'nondeployable', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'enforcing', 'return', 'duty', 'medical', 'retirement', 'also', 'demonstrates', 'management', 'affects', 'composition', 'population', 'traditional', 'approaches', 'allow', 'minority', 'subpopulation', 'soldiers', 'poor', 'prognoses', 'dwell', 'within', 'nondeployable', 'population', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'months', 'whereas', 'healthier', 'majority', 'recovers', 'within', 'first', 'months', 'creates', 'dynamic', 'remaining', 'population', 'longer', 'time', 'periods', 'increases', 'probability', 'medically', 'retired', 'demonstrates', 'councils', 'consistently', 'actively', 'shape', 'character', 'group', 'remaining', 'population', 'longer', 'periods', 'time', 'increased', 'risk', 'medical', 'retirement', 'soldier', 'medical', 'readiness', 'councils', 'already', 'adopted', 'army', 'article', 'provides', 'evidence', 'support', 'efficacy']",General Information,0,Management and Leadership

A Network Approach to Identifying Military Fleet Replacement Strategies,"The Motor Transport Program Office for the U.S. Marine Corps (PM MT) manages the Light Tactical Wheeled Vehicle (TWV) fleet and must make decisions each year about vehicle procurements, overhauls, and retirements. These decisions are based on projected costs to maintain current vehicles, estimates of the remaining useful life of the vehicles, availability of new vehicles and individual vehicle capabilities and budgets. In this portfolio analysis, the authors developed a flexible, optimization-based methodology for supporting these fleet level decisions based on cost estimates, initial inventories, operational tempo (OPTEMPO), and approved requirements documents (capabilities). Accommodating user requirements, the model uses Frontline Solver in an Excel environment, leveraging network flow constraints to decrease runtime to solution so that multiple runs of scenario excursions can expose advantages and disadvantages of different fleet management policies. A user interface was developed to allow for batch runs using design of experiment or parametric analysis of the data. The interface also helped manage the model complexity of roughly 6,000 decision variables that were developed dynamically depending on the input assumptions.",2932406045,,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Systems Engineering, U.S. Military Academy, West Point, NY, USA , Innovative Decisions, Inc., Vienna, VA, USA , Innovative Decisions, Inc., Vienna, VA, USA","Driscoll, Patrick;Newton, Harry;Mosier, Russell",,," <html><head><meta name='ValidationSchema' content='http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd'/><title></title></head><body><p>Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.

From Business Process Outsourcing to Business Process Management: Romania as an Outsourcing Destination for Portuguese Speaking Countries,"I am working at the BPO company Genpact in Bucharest, Romania as a Process Associate Accounts Payable with Portuguese. The client with which I am working is located in Portugal and it outsourced its Finance and Accounting department. This project is an analysis of the conditions for an optimal collaboration between the partners of an outsourcing process. Please see listed below a general view on the work which will follow in the next pages. I will first explain my motivation to work in a BPO company. I will then present a day in my life as a BPO company employee. Afterwards I will present a theoretical approach to outsourcing. I will also analyze the evolution of outsourcing: how and when it started; how it evolved up until today (from obvious non-core aspects being outsourced to a more in-depth approach, leading to outsourcing of aspects that might seem like core business); how it gained competitive advantage due to the economic crisis; how it will evolve in the future: is it going to be a regular aspect of a company’s strategy or is it going to lose ground along with the overcoming of the financial crisis? I will then analyze the outsourcing industry and the main players on the outsourcing market, including aspects like market share, services offered, portfolio, industries, competitive advantages and geographical locations. Companies from some of the Portuguese speaking countries (mostly Portugal and Brazil) choose to outsource part of their businesses in Romania, mostly due to low costs and services provided in Portuguese. The main local players, excluding the solely-IT services providers, are Genpact, Accenture, WNS and Wipro.

The Role of Simulation in Business Process Improvement: Difficulties and Solutions,"Due to the constant pressures that nowadays organizations have to face, they need to constantly redefine and improve their businesses. Consequently, business process improvement initiatives are of uttermost importance to overcome these challenges. Business Process Management can be the answer, as it helps organizations to respond adequately and more quickly to the pressures around them. However, business processes are complex systems involving people, activities and technology under a great dependence, variability and complexity, which makes very difficult to forecast the systems performance and behavior. In this context, computerized simulation can play an important role in business process improvement initiatives. First, business process simulation can be considered as a potential way to evaluate, in a controlled environment, the impact of changes on new or existing business processes, without taking the risks and costs of their implementation; second, it can also be considered as a change management tool since it allows to understand the reasons for changes, thus generating explanations for the decision-making process. However, despite its promises, current business process simulation approaches present some limitations that compromise their relevance as powerful tools to management decision making. This work aims, in one hand, to demonstrate the importance of computerized simulation in business process improvement initiatives and, on the other hand, to solve particular problems of business processes that are difficult to represent in discrete-event simulation tools. In this context, a catalog of 34 solutions was developed with a specific simulation tool – Simio - addressing different perspectives of recurrent problems related to human behavior in business process execution, targeted for business process modelers and simulationists. This catalog demonstrates that difficult aspects of business processes can be represented in discrete-event simulation tools, contributing to the relevance of business process simulation.",2587738076,, <html><head><meta name='ValidationSchema' content='http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd'/><title></title></head><body>O Papel na Simulação na Melhoria de Processos de Negócio: Dificuldades e Soluções</body></html>,Dissertations & Theses,,"Sousa, André Filipe Couto de",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Pay for performance in the public sector: From the National Security Personnel system to the Affordable Care Act,"Changing compensation systems for public servants toward pay for performance is one of the most alluring reform movements in the public sector. The design of compensation reforms is often based on private sector models. The central premise of these compensation systems is that they will improve both efficiency and effectiveness of government services through the use of a market compensation approach. The overarching expectation is that performance will increase in the presence of a potential increase in pecuniary rewards. A challenge with this theoretical justification in public administration is based on varying theories of motivation of public sector employees. Some may be motivated by money, while others exhibit a public service ethos based on intrinsic motivation. Another challenge is the inherent complexity in the implementation phase of pay for performance on a macro scale in large public sector institutions. This research provides two different perspectives on the effects and implementation challenges of pay for performance in the public sector. The first is a retrospective, quantitative study of the Department of Defense's National Security Personnel System. The second is a prospective analysis of the implementation of pay for performance for Medicare reimbursement under the Affordable Care Act. The juxtaposition of these different approaches using similar theoretical justification provides an opportunity to generate and discuss interagency lessons learned with using pay for performance. The results from the NSPS experience show that pay for performance may have made improvements in retention intent among DOD employees. They also indicate that recruiting may have been improved for a subset of employees in the scientific and engineering specialties. They do, however, support the notion of motivational crowding out of those who gravitate toward intrinsic motivation. The qualitative study reveals issues such as financing and the creation of effective and equitable performance metrics will continue to play integral roles for the successful implementation of pay for performance in the Medicare system. Taken together the results underscore the complexity of using pay for performance in the public sector including negative unintended consequences.",1525826844,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Dietrich,

Senior leader commitment to continuous process improvement: An exploratory study of a military organization,"To help achieve mandated reductions in spending, all departments within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) have been tasked to step up efforts to help drive waste and inefficiency from processes. As a result, the DoD has adopted continuous process improvement as 1 approach to reducing the waste embedded in current processes. The goal is to create a culture within the DoD of striving for continuous process improvement at every level and in every department, thereby improving stewardship of taxpayer dollars while meeting the nation's defense challenges. Research indicates leadership commitment is an essential ingredient in the successful implementation of continuous process improvement in organizations. However, little qualitative research is available regarding the factors that compel senior leaders within organizations to initially consider continuous process improvement, commit to continuous process improvement, or sustain commitment to continuous process improvement. Literature related to organizational culture, change, and leadership was critically reviewed. In-depth interviews with 18 individuals selected from a pool of 146 senior leaders within a department of the DoD were used to investigate the experiences, perceptions, and insights of senior leaders with respect to commitment to continuous improvement. Participants in this study indicated that senior leader commitment is essential if an organization is to enjoy the benefits of continuous process improvement. Participants revealed that continuous process improvement was good for the organization and worth the effort expended. Meaningful results that lead to improved mission accomplishment have a strong influence on a senior leader's willingness to commit to and sustain continuous process improvement. Participants indicated they were committed to continuous process improvement but noted that continuous process improvement can be an administrative burden. Participants asserted that credibility is critical when demonstrating their commitment to other members of the organization. Participants opined that top management must be willing to empower senior leaders to implement challenging or risky solutions. Building on the very limited understanding of senior leader commitment to process improvement, the findings of this study provide a better understanding of how senior leaders make the decision to commit to and sustain continuous improvement in organizations.",1461460663,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Hamm, Robert Earl, Jr.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in

Triazine-mediated disruption of BLTK1 Leydig cell steroidogenesis,"Triazines are broad spectrum herbicides implicated in the etiology of testicular dysgenesis eliciting perturbations of gonad development and reproductive function. In rodents triazines alter the onset of puberty, cause reproductive senescence, and disrupt reproductive tract development including dysregulation of androgen-dependent tissue development. Disruption of testosterone biosynthesis is thought to underlie the effects of triazines in males across vertebrate species. However, the current approaches used to identify developmental and reproductive toxicants involve in vivo studies evaluating apical endpoints that are generally descriptive and do not contribute to the elucidation of mechanism of action. As such, the mechanism by which triazines disrupt steroidogenesis remains unknown. The objectives of this study were to establish a model for the evaluation of triazines effects on steroidogenesis that is amenable to mechanism determination and to identify a possible mode of action for triazine-elicited disruption of steroidogenesis. BLTK1 Leydig cells were characterized and demonstrated to be a viable in vitro model for the evaluation of endocrine disruptor-mediated effects on steroidogenesis. BLTK1 cells express all necessary steroidogenic enzymes essential for hormone biosynthesis and maintain low basal levels of testosterone (T) production, inducible by recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (rhCG) and forskolin (FSK). The time- and concentration-dependent effects of triazine herbicides, atrazine (ATR), propazine (PRO), simazine (SIM) and terbuthylazine (TBA), and their chlorometabolites, desethylatrazine (DEA), desisopropylatrazine (DIA) and diamino- s -chlorotriazine (DACT), were evaluated in BLTK1 Leydig cells. Triazines and their chlorometabolites induced concentration-dependent increases in basal progesterone (P) and T levels. Triazines also elicited the differential gene expression of several steroidogenic enzymes required for steroidogenesis. These results were consistent with the cumulative risk assessment ""Common Mechanism Group"" designation that PRO, SIM, DEA, DIA and DACT have ATR-like effects. Using ATR as the representative triazine, whole-genome microarrays identified differential gene expression at later time points (&gt; 12 hr) with affected genes associated with steroidogenesis and cholesterol metabolism. Finally, the effects of ATR on rhCG-mediated induction of steroidogenesis revealed antagonism of P and T levels, despite potentiation of intracellular cAMP levels. The inhibition of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases was identified as underlying increases in cAMP levels. However, the ATR-mediated super-induction of cAMP levels was not causative of T antagonism in the presence of rhCG. Disruption of phosphorylation cascades likely contribute to ATR-mediated effects on steroidogenesis, with observed effects on protein kinase A (PKA) target proteins. This study has established BLTK1 cells as a novel in vitro steroidogenic model for the evaluation of endocrine disrupting chemicals and the evaluation of triazines in BLTK1 cells has expanded our knowledge of triazine-mediated disruption of steroidogenesis.",1431534062,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Forgacs, Agnes",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the

The influence of contemporary Army culture on senior enlisted women's decision to commit to a lifelong career,"This phenomenological study explored a gap in knowledge that currently exists pertaining to the experiences of senior enlisted women who have served in the active Army from 2001-2011. The purpose of the study was to investigate their experiences and perceptions regarding their specific profession, the profession of arms, and their personal and professional reasons for committing to a lifelong career in the Army. Current data indicate that women comprise 13.5% of the U.S. Army. In addition, a 2007 survey conducted by the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) indicated that 66% of men planned to stay in the Army until retirement, whereas only 49% of women indicated a goal of making the Army their career. Identifying the difference between career persistence among men and women is important not only to women seeking a potential career in the Army but also to the future of the Army's recruiting practices, demographics, and prospective policies and procedures. This study used a convenience sample and snowball sampling to identify participants. Individual interviews were conducted with a target population of 17 senior enlisted women. The goal of these interviews was to (a) obtain the participants ' insights regarding their decisions to select the Army as a career choice, (b) gain a clearer understanding of supportive or nonsupportive experiences they encountered relevant to their career decisions, (c) delve into their decisions regarding family versus career, and (d) attain their opinions concerning promotional opportunities for senior enlisted women. Interviews were transcribed and coded into themes that emerged from those data and from the literature review. An overview of the results of this phenomenological study is indicated in Chapter 4. Findings and conclusions of the research are discussed in Chapter 5. Recommendations for future research include; completing this research with women of other services and reexamining Army active duty women's experiences in the next 5 years.",1427847908,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Williams, Nanette Marie",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2013," Social sciences , Army , Career choice , Gender , Great man theory , Military , Senior enlisted promotions , Women soldiers , Work-life balance", 978-1-303-24833-7,,, English, English,,,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/influence-contemporary-army-culture-on-senior/docview/1427847908/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+influence+of+contemporary+Army+culture+on+senior+enlisted+women%27s+decision+to+commit+to+a+lifelong+career&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Williams%2C+Nanette+Marie&amp;isbn=978-1-303-24833-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch Collection, Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",phenomenological explored gap knowledge currently exists pertaining experience senior enlisted woman served active army purpose investigate experience perception regarding specific profession profession arm personal professional reason committing lifelong career army current indicate woman comprise army addition survey conducted advisory committee woman service dacowits indicated men planned stay army retirement whereas woman indicated goal making army career identifying difference career persistence among men woman important woman seeking potential career army also future army recruiting practice demographic prospective policy procedure used convenience sample snowball sampling identify participant individual interview conducted target population senior enlisted woman goal interview obtain participant insight regarding decision select army career choice gain clearer understanding supportive nonsupportive experience encountered relevant career decision delve decision regarding family versus career attain opinion concerning promotional opportunity senior enlisted woman interview transcribed coded theme emerged literature review overview result phenomenological indicated chapter finding conclusion discussed chapter recommendation future include completing woman service reexamining army active duty woman experience next year,"['phenomenological', 'explored', 'gap', 'knowledge', 'currently', 'exists', 'pertaining', 'experiences', 'senior', 'enlisted', 'women', 'served', 'active', 'army', 'purpose', 'investigate', 'experiences', 'perceptions', 'regarding', 'specific', 'profession', 'profession', 'arms', 'personal', 'professional', 'reasons', 'committing', 'lifelong', 'career', 'army', 'current', 'data', 'indicate', 'women', 'comprise', 'army', 'addition', 'survey', 'conducted', 'advisory', 'committee', 'women', 'services', 'dacowits', 'indicated', 'men', 'planned', 'stay', 'army', 'retirement', 'whereas', 'women', 'indicated', 'goal', 'making', 'army', 'career', 'identifying', 'difference', 'career', 'persistence', 'among', 'men', 'women', 'important', 'women', 'seeking', 'potential', 'career', 'army', 'also', 'future', 'army', 'recruiting', 'practices', 'demographics', 'prospective', 'policies', 'procedures', 'used', 'convenience', 'sample', 'snowball', 'sampling', 'identify', 'participants', 'individual', 'interviews', 'conducted', 'target', 'population', 'senior', 'enlisted', 'women', 'goal', 'interviews', 'obtain', 'participants', 'insights', 'regarding', 'decisions', 'select', 'army', 'career', 'choice', 'gain', 'clearer', 'understanding', 'supportive', 'nonsupportive', 'experiences', 'encountered', 'relevant', 'career', 'decisions', 'delve', 'decisions', 'regarding', 'family', 'versus', 'career', 'attain', 'opinions', 'concerning', 'promotional', 'opportunities', 'senior', 'enlisted', 'women', 'interviews', 'transcribed', 'coded', 'themes', 'emerged', 'data', 'literature', 'review', 'overview', 'results', 'phenomenological', 'indicated', 'chapter', 'findings', 'conclusions', 'discussed', 'chapter', 'recommendations', 'future', 'include', 'completing', 'women', 'services', 'reexamining', 'army', 'active', 'duty', 'women', 'experiences', 'next', 'years']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Project management professional training needs for defense industry projects,"The purpose of this study was to determine if the Project Management Professional credential requirements encompass the knowledge for project managers required to effectively manage defense industry projects. This study used a four-round Delphi methodology to solicit opinions of defense industry project management professionals about current project management credential curriculum and if that curriculum reflects the realities of the current project management environment. Two research questions guided this study: 1) Do government contractors working on defense projects use project management knowledge and abilities that are different from what the Project Management Professional credential requires? and 2) Are there additional skill sets needed for project managers to successfully work in the defense industry? Participants in this study were selected from a project management training company based in the southeastern United States. Project management training professionals were selected due to the unique credentials required of participants in this study. From a population of sixteen defense industry project management training professionals, fourteen agreed to serve on the Delphi panel. The first round asked an open-ended question about knowledge and abilities required by defense industry project management professionals. The panel identified thirteen knowledge and abilities as additions to the Project Management Professional credential for project managers to effectively manage defense industry projects. In the second round, participants evaluated the knowledge and abilities identified in the first round, assigning varying ratings from limited relevance to significant relevance. In the third round, the participants compared their evaluations with the evaluations of the other participants in aggregate. Consensus was built on the identified knowledge and abilities which ranged from limited relevance to significant relevance. In the fourth round, the participants were given a final opportunity to decide if the knowledge and abilities are either necessary, supplemental, or neither. Five knowledge and abilities were found to be necessary, six were found to be supplemental, one was identified as neither, and one was identified equally as necessary and supplemental by the panel. The findings of the study identified competencies unique to the defense industry project management field, including Management of Contracts, Developing Positive Relationships with Stakeholders, Knowledge of Customer Organization, Leading a Team of People with Diverse Backgrounds, Knowledge of Communication with Government Customers, and Knowledge of DoD 5000 Series Regulations. Thus it is recommended that the defense industry needs an appropriate project management certification to fit its unique operational requirements. These findings provide knowledge for the project management field that should be included in training programs provided by colleges, companies, and consultants.",1425244872,,,Dissertations &

STEWARDSHIP IN THE DESERT: Making and Saving Money in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operation,"As the new era of fiscal reality has consumed America's security apparatus, defense budgets continue to descend from their high watermark of 2008, sequestration is a reality, the Defense Industrial Base fears massive layoffs and reductions, and the Department of Defense is at task to produce auditable financial statements by 2017, one thing hasn't changed -- the ends. The ends are nonnegotiabIe -- US Government will protect the national security interests of the US of America. The country's National Security Strategy attempts to provide that answer without the application of resource constraints. Several key stewardship programs are in place to day to help the Southwest Asia theater's leaders achieve these objectives. The theater's major cost drivers fall primarily into the categories of contracts (outsourced capabilities), equipment (acquisitions), and supplies (stock-funded and nonstock-funded items), transportation, and several unique programs such as the theater's Commanders Emergency Response Program. This article looks briefly at those US Army Central-managed stewardship programs implemented across the Combined Joint Operations Area.",1370197114,,,Trade Journals,,"Horlander, Thomas A, CDFM", AFCMAF,, Copyright American Society of Military Comptrollers Winter 2013,,, Feature,, Winter 2013," Military strategy , Western Asia , Military operation , Military , Theatre , Southwest Asia , Stewardship",,0004-2188,1.0, English, English,, 34-36, Alexandria,Winter 2013,The Armed Forces Comptroller,2013,,58.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/stewardship-desert-making-saving-money-southwest/docview/1370197114/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aaccounting&amp;atitle=STEWARDSHIP+IN+THE+DESERT%3A+Making+and+Saving+Money+in+the+Southwest+Asia+Theater+of+Operation&amp;title=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;issn=00042188&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=58&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=34&amp;au=Horlander%2C+Thomas+A%2C+CDFM&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",new era fiscal reality consumed america security apparatus budget continue descend high watermark sequestration reality industrial base fear massive layoff reduction task produce auditable financial statement one thing changed end end nonnegotiabie government protect national security interest america country national security strategy attempt provide answer without application resource constraint several key stewardship program place day help southwest asia theater leader achieve objective theater major cost driver fall primarily category contract outsourced capability equipment acquisition supply item transportation several unique program theater commander emergency response program article look briefly army stewardship program implemented across combined joint operation area,"['new', 'era', 'fiscal', 'reality', 'consumed', 'america', 'security', 'apparatus', 'budgets', 'continue', 'descend', 'high', 'watermark', 'sequestration', 'reality', 'industrial', 'base', 'fears', 'massive', 'layoffs', 'reductions', 'task', 'produce', 'auditable', 'financial', 'statements', 'one', 'thing', 'changed', 'ends', 'ends', 'nonnegotiabie', 'government', 'protect', 'national', 'security', 'interests', 'america', 'country', 'national', 'security', 'strategy', 'attempts', 'provide', 'answer', 'without', 'application', 'resource', 'constraints', 'several', 'key', 'stewardship', 'programs', 'place', 'day', 'help', 'southwest', 'asia', 'theater', 'leaders', 'achieve', 'objectives', 'theater', 'major', 'cost', 'drivers', 'fall', 'primarily', 'categories', 'contracts', 'outsourced', 'capabilities', 'equipment', 'acquisitions', 'supplies', 'items', 'transportation', 'several', 'unique', 'programs', 'theater', 'commanders', 'emergency', 'response', 'program', 'article', 'looks', 'briefly', 'army', 'stewardship', 'programs', 'implemented', 'across', 'combined', 'joint', 'operations', 'area']",Feature,2,Management and Leadership
Lean principles and defense information technology acquisition: An investigation of the determinants of successful application,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not there have been successful applications of lean manufacturing principles in highly variable defense IT environments. Specifically, the study assessed if implementation of the lean philosophies by a defense organization yielded repeatable, predictable results in software release schedules reductions. Additionally, the study set out to determine what potential critical success factors (CSF's) were documented in the secondary data captured for each release, and extracted the variables used in the decision making for acceptability of fielding. In evaluating lean applicability to the high variability environment of USAF IT acquisitions, the research was conducted using non-experimental quantitative methods of archival secondary data. The sample for this case study was compiled from a USAF office that had implemented these techniques in pre-development, development and testing, and fielding phases. Based on the research data, acquisitionists and lean practitioners are inherently interconnected. Therefore, an understanding that critical success factors (CSFs) are integral to successful lean application in DoD IT acquisitions is crucial. Through a combination of synergistic alignments, plyometric CSFs were discovered to maximize the effects of each single CSF to produce rapid results in defense IT acquisitions. These include: (1) Enterprise Incorporation, (2) Team Trust, (3) Transformational Leadership, (4) Recursive Improvement, (5) Integrated Synergy, (6) Customer-Centric Culture and (7) Heuristic Communication.",1367178418,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Haley, M.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2013," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Acquisitions , Critical success factors , Defense , Information technology , Lean , Process improvement", 978-1-303-08558-1,,, English, English,,,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/lean-principles-defense-information-technology/docview/1367178418/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Lean+principles+and+defense+information+technology+acquisition%3A+An+investigation+of+the+determinants+of+successful+application&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Haley%2C+M.&amp;isbn=978-1-303-08558-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,purpose investigate whether successful application lean manufacturing principle highly variable environment specifically assessed implementation lean philosophy organization yielded repeatable predictable result software release schedule reduction additionally set determine potential critical success factor csf documented secondary captured release extracted variable used decision making acceptability fielding evaluating lean applicability high variability environment usaf acquisition conducted using quantitative method archival secondary sample case compiled usaf office implemented technique development testing fielding phase based acquisitionists lean practitioner inherently interconnected therefore understanding critical success factor csfs integral successful lean application acquisition crucial combination synergistic alignment plyometric csfs discovered maximize effect single csf produce rapid result acquisition include enterprise incorporation team trust transformational leadership recursive improvement integrated synergy culture heuristic communication,"['purpose', 'investigate', 'whether', 'successful', 'applications', 'lean', 'manufacturing', 'principles', 'highly', 'variable', 'environments', 'specifically', 'assessed', 'implementation', 'lean', 'philosophies', 'organization', 'yielded', 'repeatable', 'predictable', 'results', 'software', 'release', 'schedules', 'reductions', 'additionally', 'set', 'determine', 'potential', 'critical', 'success', 'factors', 'csf', 'documented', 'secondary', 'data', 'captured', 'release', 'extracted', 'variables', 'used', 'decision', 'making', 'acceptability', 'fielding', 'evaluating', 'lean', 'applicability', 'high', 'variability', 'environment', 'usaf', 'acquisitions', 'conducted', 'using', 'quantitative', 'methods', 'archival', 'secondary', 'data', 'sample', 'case', 'compiled', 'usaf', 'office', 'implemented', 'techniques', 'development', 'testing', 'fielding', 'phases', 'based', 'data', 'acquisitionists', 'lean', 'practitioners', 'inherently', 'interconnected', 'therefore', 'understanding', 'critical', 'success', 'factors', 'csfs', 'integral', 'successful', 'lean', 'application', 'acquisitions', 'crucial', 'combination', 'synergistic', 'alignments', 'plyometric', 'csfs', 'discovered', 'maximize', 'effects', 'single', 'csf', 'produce', 'rapid', 'results', 'acquisitions', 'include', 'enterprise', 'incorporation', 'team', 'trust', 'transformational', 'leadership', 'recursive', 'improvement', 'integrated', 'synergy', 'culture', 'heuristic', 'communication']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Continuous Learning
A holistic compliance model for capture teams: A grounded theory approach,"By the time a Department of Defense (DOD) Request for Proposal (RFP) is awarded, its initial targets have moved, in many cases so much as to render any replies by the defense industry to an RFP useless. Requirements tend to evolve during the development of systems specifications. This may be caused in part by new information acquired during the period prior to the award of the RFP, thereby mandating changes in how the system performs. This research will address one small but important part of these problems: the development and specification of requirements analysis. The intended strategy in conducting this research is to review and analyze the existing body of knowledge about holistic compliance, capture teams, and RFP standards and requirements. By performing content analysis of the unstructured texts published by a United States DOD acquisition organization originating an RFP, themes will be uncovered. The resulting themes will be instrumental in designing a theory that could explain how holistic compliance is actualized in a capture team's proposal efforts during the evolution of an RFP. This study will use the grounded systems engineering methodology (GSEM) framework, devised by Galal and Paul (1999) to establish requirements pertinent to the assessment and description of the RFP.

Exploring Knowledge Sharing in the Department of Defense,"Reports indicated that misunderstandings exist among leaders, managers, and employees about the knowledge-sharing process between individuals and within the social structure of teams. Organizations that do not implement knowledge management strategies will not remain competitive in the 21st century. The purpose of this phenomenological research study was to use Nonaka and Takeuchi's socialization, externalization, internalization, and combination model to explore the organized, continual method of tacit-to-explicit knowledge theory for organizational knowledge creation. Twenty participants, consisting of government-contracting professionals possessing 5 years or less experience and senior employees with 10 years or more experience, shared their lived experiences in semistructured interviews. The central research question addressed the issues, claims, and concerns behind the employees' perceptions regarding knowledge sharing within the contracting division at a Department of Defense organization. Interview data were coded, analyzed, and grouped into 10 primary themes; results indicated that the foundation for supporting the knowledge sharing process consists of implementing a culture of openness and willingness to share from upper management to individual employees and between individual workers. With improvements and attention given to organizational culture and internal changes from upper management and leadership, issues of trust regarding knowledge sharing have the potential to improve. The implications for social change are that employers may promote knowledge management principles to encourage a more competent, successful, and effective work and business environments.",1335897804,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Connell, Melissa Ann",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2013," Social sciences , Department of Defense , Explicit knowledge , Knowledge management , Knowledge sharing , Leadership , SECI model , Tacit knowledge", 978-1-267-99893-4,,, English, English,,,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploring-knowledge-sharing-department-defense/docview/1335897804/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploring+Knowledge+Sharing+in+the+Department+of+Defense&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Connell%2C+Melissa+Ann&amp;isbn=978-1-267-99893-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,report indicated misunderstanding exist among leader manager employee process individual within social structure team organization implement knowledge management strategy remain competitive century purpose phenomenological use nonaka takeuchi socialization externalization internalization combination model explore organized continual knowledge theory organizational knowledge creation twenty participant consisting professional possessing year less experience senior employee year experience shared lived experience semistructured interview central question addressed issue claim concern behind employee perception regarding knowledge sharing within contracting division organization interview coded analyzed grouped primary theme result indicated foundation supporting knowledge sharing process consists implementing culture openness willingness share upper management individual employee individual worker improvement attention given organizational culture internal change upper management leadership issue trust regarding knowledge sharing potential improve implication social change employer may promote knowledge management principle encourage competent successful effective work business environment,"['reports', 'indicated', 'misunderstandings', 'exist', 'among', 'leaders', 'managers', 'employees', 'process', 'individuals', 'within', 'social', 'structure', 'teams', 'organizations', 'implement', 'knowledge', 'management', 'strategies', 'remain', 'competitive', 'century', 'purpose', 'phenomenological', 'use', 'nonaka', 'takeuchi', 'socialization', 'externalization', 'internalization', 'combination', 'model', 'explore', 'organized', 'continual', 'knowledge', 'theory', 'organizational', 'knowledge', 'creation', 'twenty', 'participants', 'consisting', 'professionals', 'possessing', 'years', 'less', 'experience', 'senior', 'employees', 'years', 'experience', 'shared', 'lived', 'experiences', 'semistructured', 'interviews', 'central', 'question', 'addressed', 'issues', 'claims', 'concerns', 'behind', 'employees', 'perceptions', 'regarding', 'knowledge', 'sharing', 'within', 'contracting', 'division', 'organization', 'interview', 'data', 'coded', 'analyzed', 'grouped', 'primary', 'themes', 'results', 'indicated', 'foundation', 'supporting', 'knowledge', 'sharing', 'process', 'consists', 'implementing', 'culture', 'openness', 'willingness', 'share', 'upper', 'management', 'individual', 'employees', 'individual', 'workers', 'improvements', 'attention', 'given', 'organizational', 'culture', 'internal', 'changes', 'upper', 'management', 'leadership', 'issues', 'trust', 'regarding', 'knowledge', 'sharing', 'potential', 'improve', 'implications', 'social', 'change', 'employers', 'may', 'promote', 'knowledge', 'management', 'principles', 'encourage', 'competent', 'successful', 'effective', 'work', 'business', 'environments']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
The Impact of an ISO 9000-Compliant Quality Management System on Product Quality from Suppliers in a DOD Procurement Environment,"The ISO 9000 family of standards, first issued in 1987, has been accepted as the worldwide standard for quality management systems, having more than one million companies, representing 178 countries, registered to it as of 2009. Companies implement this standard either voluntarily and proactively, or may be requested to do so by their customers, with the expectation that it will help to maintain, if not improve, the quality of the products/services that they provide. Most research efforts that have investigated the impact of ISO 9000 on product/service quality have used subjective data acquired from surveys or interviews of company employees or managers. For the small number of studies that have used actual objective product data, the products have represented a limited range of materials, technologies, and industries. The purpose of this investigation is to provide insights into the relationship between ISO 9000 conformance of suppliers and the quality of products they provide, within a procurement system of a manufacturer operating under contracts with the United States Department of Defense. To achieve this, chi-square tests of independence were performed to compare the receipt acceptance rate of material provided by ISO 9000-conforming suppliers to that of non-ISO 9000-conforming suppliers, for more than 46,000 receipts provided by almost 800 suppliers. Data subsets were analyzed to determine the quality impact of ISO 9000 conformance for several commodity groups, for manufacturers versus distributors, and for two material control levels. Results were mixed, but for the overall data set, and for almost half of the data subsets analyzed, the product quality of non-ISO 9000-conforming suppliers was significantly better than that of ISO 9001-conforming suppliers.",1322071958,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Blessner, Paul L.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2013," Applied sciences , DOD procurement environment , Iso 9000 , Product quality , Quality management , Suppliers", 978-1-267-97140-1,,, English, English,,,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/impact-iso-9000-compliant-quality-management/docview/1322071958/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Impact+of+an+ISO+9000-Compliant+Quality+Management+System+on+Product+Quality+from+Suppliers+in+a+DOD+Procurement+Environment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Blessner%2C+Paul+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-267-97140-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",iso family standard first issued accepted worldwide standard quality management system one million company representing country registered company implement standard either voluntarily proactively may requested customer expectation help maintain improve quality provide effort investigated impact iso quality used subjective acquired survey interview company employee manager small number study used actual objective product product represented limited range material technology industry purpose investigation provide insight relationship iso conformance supplier quality product provide within procurement system manufacturer operating contract united state achieve test independence performed compare receipt acceptance rate material provided iso supplier supplier receipt provided almost supplier subset analyzed determine quality impact iso conformance several commodity group manufacturer versus distributor two material control level result mixed overall set almost half subset analyzed product quality supplier significantly better iso supplier,"['iso', 'family', 'standards', 'first', 'issued', 'accepted', 'worldwide', 'standard', 'quality', 'management', 'systems', 'one', 'million', 'companies', 'representing', 'countries', 'registered', 'companies', 'implement', 'standard', 'either', 'voluntarily', 'proactively', 'may', 'requested', 'customers', 'expectation', 'help', 'maintain', 'improve', 'quality', 'provide', 'efforts', 'investigated', 'impact', 'iso', 'quality', 'used', 'subjective', 'data', 'acquired', 'surveys', 'interviews', 'company', 'employees', 'managers', 'small', 'number', 'studies', 'used', 'actual', 'objective', 'product', 'data', 'products', 'represented', 'limited', 'range', 'materials', 'technologies', 'industries', 'purpose', 'investigation', 'provide', 'insights', 'relationship', 'iso', 'conformance', 'suppliers', 'quality', 'products', 'provide', 'within', 'procurement', 'system', 'manufacturer', 'operating', 'contracts', 'united', 'states', 'achieve', 'tests', 'independence', 'performed', 'compare', 'receipt', 'acceptance', 'rate', 'material', 'provided', 'iso', 'suppliers', 'suppliers', 'receipts', 'provided', 'almost', 'suppliers', 'data', 'subsets', 'analyzed', 'determine', 'quality', 'impact', 'iso', 'conformance', 'several', 'commodity', 'groups', 'manufacturers', 'versus', 'distributors', 'two', 'material', 'control', 'levels', 'results', 'mixed', 'overall', 'data', 'set', 'almost', 'half', 'data', 'subsets', 'analyzed', 'product', 'quality', 'suppliers', 'significantly', 'better', 'iso', 'suppliers']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Management and Leadership

"Abstracts from the Society for Clinical Trials Annual Meeting, Miami, May 21-23, 2012","A decision of the Federal Joint Committee Germany states that negative pressure wound therapy is not accepted as a standard therapy with full reimbursement by the health insurance companies in Germany. This decision is based on the rapid report and the final report of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, which demonstrated through systematic reviews and meta-analysis of previous studies projects that an insufficient state of evidence regarding the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for treatment of acute and chronic wounds exists. The Institute for Research in Operative Medicine (IFOM) as part of the University of Witten / Herdecke gGmbH is an independent scientific institute that is responsible for the planning, implementation, analysis and publication of trial projects regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy for acute and chronic wounds in both medical sectors (in- and outpatient care) in Germany. The study projects are designed and conducted with the aim to provide solid evidence regarding the efficacy of NPWT. The trials evaluate the treatment outcome of the application of a technical medical device which is based on the principle of negative pressure wound therapy (Intervention Group) in comparison to standard wound therapy (Control group) in the treatment of chronic foot wounds and acute subcutaneous abdominal wounds after surgery. All used treatment systems bear the CE mark and will be used within normal conditions of clinical routine and according to manufacturer's instructions. The aim of the trial projects is to compare the clinical, safety and economic results of both treatment arms. Study results will be provided until the end of 2014 to contribute to the final decision of the Federal Joint Committee Germany regarding the general admission of negative pressure wound therapy as a standard of performance within both medical sectors. Introduction: Adequate patient recruitment is a key condition determining the validity, duration and costs of RCTs, yet remains challenging. The expanding interface between therapeutic endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery for the treatment of benign gastrointestinal diseases demands RCTs to compare safety and cost-effectiveness of comparable interventions. We aimed to identify patient motives and barriers for (non)participation in the TREND study. Methods: Patients with large rectal adenomas counseled between January and July 2011 for participation in an RCT comparing endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) with transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) were invited for a semi-structured interview (14 participants, 12 non- participants). Interviewees were asked to discuss their main motive for (non-) participation in an open fashion. Subsequently, potential other barriers and motivations as previously described in the literature were presented by the interviewer. Interviews were coded and analyzed by 2 independent researchers. Results: We interviewed 10 participants and 7 non-participants, aged 54-84. Key motive for trial participation was contribution to medical science and future clinical practice (all participants). Other motives included satisfactory counseling, sufficient time to reflect and the sense that participation was completely voluntary. The vast majority of non-participants had previous in-hospital experience, however more than half had not been introduced to research prior. Although most non-participants felt contributing to research was important, key barriers to participation included a distinct preference for either EMR (n=4) or TEM (n=3) or intervention-specific characteristics like type of sedation (all non-participants). Consultation of family members affected half of all decisions. Study characteristics such as randomization, blinding, insurance and ethical approval hardly influenced the decision making. Conclusion: In RCTs comparing similar endoscopic and surgical strategies, thorough, tailored and timely counseling is crucial to clarify the study purpose and to emphasize the presumed equality of allocation arms. Avoidance of common barriers to participation will improve trial inclusion. The establishment of clinical trial centers creates a demand for both infrastructure and skilled staff. While establishment and operation of clinical trial centers in surgical specialties have in recent years often been conducted by medical staff in addition to clinical practice, the intensification of legal regulations and the increased number of clinical trials in surgery requires rethinking. The ability to fulfill these more specialized demands can only be given by allocating sufficient funds. These funds can be used to employ trained paramedical staff and furthermore to release medical staff from clinical work and thereby enable full-time scientific work. On the other hand, a demand for funding is risen to implement infrastructural requirements such as IT hardware and premises. Once a clinical trial center has been established, further operation has to be ensured by generating additional funds. While the demand for start-up financing of a clinical trial unit is most meaningful arranged by governmental or institutional fundraising, the operation relies on generating sufficient funds through the conduction of industry-initiated trials. Own experience and further possibilities are demonstrated by reporting on different strategies for funding of clinical trial centers and the general demand of funds during establishment and operation of clinical trial centers. Therefore, different governmental, industrial as well as institutional supports are relevant factors. In Europe safety management requirements in clinical trials with medical devices were changed fundamentally by the council directive 2007/47/EC in 2007 and internationally with the ISO 14155:2011 in 2011. Previously adverse incidents had to be reported to the competent authority. Since implementation of the directive in Germany each serious adverse event (SAE) which happened or might have happened to a patient, user, or third party, must be reported immediately. Sponsor and investigators must report SAEs via an electronic form centrally provided by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). Besides profound knowledge adequate IT equipment at all investigator trial sites are needed. The latter being a challenge for academic trials with their low budgets. To develop operational competence the quality management (QM) working group of the Clinical Trials Centers (CTC)-network developed a harmonized SOP describing thecomplex procedures of safety management for sponsor and investigator trial sites. It includes appendices providing among others definitions, a template for an SAE-manual, and instructions for completing the electronic form. This document particularly suggests solutions regarding more general regulatory requirements,e.g. follow-up information for the sponsor or for the competent authority. The implemented safety management procedures consider experiences derived from clinical trials with medicinal products and the special characteristics of academic trials. As increased numbers of clinical trials with medical devices are to be expected according to changed regulations CTCs will become more experienced with these complex procedures. Thus they will be competent partners to industry in conducting national and international clinical trials with medical devices. Our report will show the challenges of coping with this novel electronic reporting process, and provide our experiences in fulfilling the updated changed German national regulations. Due to the ever increasing global activity in clinical research, knowledge transfer between researchers and all stakeholders in clinical health care (including patients) worldwide is an indispensable requirement. A prerequisite for knowledge transfer in clinical research is an unbiased and complete view on clinical trial results. How is the arising number of clinical trials registries and results databases being utilized by different user groups including ethics committees, clinicians, patients, researchers, reimbursement and funding institutions? What are the different requirements defined by the parties involved? How can variable needs be met? What seem to be the arising issues concerning database content, language barriers, retrieval problems, implementation of knowledge into daily work, evaluation of existing evidence? What efforts are made to overcome the obstacles? Meanwhile it is daily experience that conduct of a clinical quality assurance audit involves some kind of computer system to be considered and assessed. The following fundamental question comes immediately to mind: how valid are data and information kept and handled by the systems employed? This question will be subdivided in five parts for the purpose of this session: Where does the basic computer system used come from, how has it been implemented and validated and how is it maintained? How has the computer system application used in a specific trial been developed, validated and deployed and how is it operated and maintained? Which regulations, guidelines and state of the art standards are to be expected to be observed for development, validation and operation? How big are the risks on data quality and acceptability of the study outcome in case of malfunction of the computer system application? How high are chances that system weaknesses can be detected in a standard audit setting and how can auditors optimise the preparation and conduct of their review to detect hidden system bugs? The session presents an overview over the current situation, naming specific risks and gives some answers to the questions posed afore, mainly by giving practical examples how to proceed in the most frequent audit situations, namely investigator site audits (eClinical and electronic source documents), CRO system audits and vendor audits. A flexible and simple Bayesian decision- theoretic design for dose finding trials is proposed in this paper. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we adopt a working model which produces analytic posterior distributions. In addition, this working model is sufficiently flexible to fit all monotonic dose-toxicity curves. We also discuss how to use a proper utility function to reflect the interest of the trial. Patients are allocated based on not only the utility function but also the chosen dose selection rule. The most popular dose selection rule is the one-step-look-ahead (OSLA), which selects the best so far dose. More complicated rules such as two-step-look- ahead (TSLA) are surely more efficient than OSLA only when the required distributional assumptions are met which is however often not the case in practice. We carry out extensive simulation studies to evaluate a variety of dose selection rules and have found that OSLA is often more efficient than TSLA under our proposed method. Moreover, our simulation results show that the proposed method performs superior to several popular Bayesian methods and the negative impact of prior mis-specification could be considered in the design stage. Isotonic Design using Normalized Equivalent Toxicity Score (ID-NETS) is a novel Phase I design originally proposed by Chen et al. by integrating the novel toxicity scoring system proposed by Chen et al. and the original Isotonic Design proposed by Leung et al. ID-NETS has substantially improved the accuracy of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation and efficiency of trial by fully utilizing all toxicities of each patient and treating toxicity response as a quasi-continuous variable instead of a binary indicator of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in a Phase I clinical trial. To facilitate designing and conducting a Phase I clinical trial with ID-NETS, we have developed a user-friendly software ID-NETS©TM, which has two functions: 1) Calculating the recommended next dose level from completed data; and 2) Performing simulation to obtain the operating characteristics of a trial. Currently, ID-NETS©TM v1.0 is available for download at http://winshipbbisr.emory.edu/IDNETS.html. Building on the toxicity probability interval (TPI) design in Ji et al. (2007), we present a modified TPI design (mTPI) that is calibration-free for phase I trials. Our goal is to further simplify the design and improve the trial conduct, and provide more effective and safer methods while maintaining the simplicity of the original TPI design. Like the TPI method, mTPI consists of a practical dose-finding scheme guided by the posterior inference using a simple Bayesian model. However, the new method benefits from improved dose-finding decision rules based on a new statistic, the unit probability mass (UPM). The improvement through the use of the UPM for dose finding is significant. We will present extensive simulation results comparing the mTPI design to the 3+3 and CRM methods, and provide convincing evidence why the mTPI is a practically superior method. Among the most recent advances in escalation with overdose control (EWOC) based Bayesian adaptive phase I clinical trial designs, Tighiouart et al (2011) developed EWOC based on the proportional hazards model (EWOC-PH) using time to toxicity to estimate the MTD. The method has been shown to be more efficient to estimate MTD comparing to the original EWOC and a version of time to event EWOC (TITE-EWOC) proposed by Mauguen et al (2010). In this study, we will further extent EWOC-PH to take into account patients' baseline covariates. The extension of EWOC to accommodate baseline covariates has been developed by Babb and Rogatko (2001) and Tighiouart and Rogatko (2010). We expect that the new design will provide better safety protection by assigning a personalized dose to the next available patient based on his/her own baseline characteristics and lead to an estimation for covariate specific phase II dose. We assess the operating characteristics for the design via extensive simulations including three scenarios: (1) design using a covariate; (2) Design ignoring the covariate; (3) Design using separate trials. The efficiency of estimating the conditional MTD and safety of the trial are compared with original EWOC with covariate using DLT as a binary indicator of toxicity. Escalation with overdose control (EWOC) is a successful Phase I design and has been widely used. Chen et al. further extended EWOC to utilize fully all toxicities of patients instead of a binary indicator of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) by incorporating the normalized toxicity scoring system (NETS) proposed by Chen et al. into EWOC with a quasi-Bernoulli likelihood approach. The new design is called EWOC-NETS which has been demonstrated by simulation studies to have good operating characteristics and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation relative to common Phase I designs. In this study, we have developed an interactive software called EWOC-NETS©TM which is very user friendly to facilitate designing and conducting a Phase I clinical trial with EWOC-NETS and available for free download at the website of Emory University http://winshipbbisr.emory.edu/Software.html. We would like to introduce this novel statistical software and translate EWOC-NETS into Phase I cancer clinical trials in the future. Some clinical predictors may or may not have monotonic properties. They may have increasing or decreasing pattern or they may remain steady during a period of observation time. A clinical question is raised on how such increasing or decreasing or constant pattern of variations may have effect on survival or on clinical outcomes independently during a period of time. Generally we ignore such point of transitions and independent pattern of variations while investigating their overall effect. Isotonicity is called the simple or partial ordered monotonicity mathematically. Isotonic regression is performed under ordered monotonic restrictions criteria. Either increasing or decreasing or constant variation of a clinical predicator or of a prognostic variable generates a change-point problem at the transition from increasing order to decreasing order or vice versa or from the steady condition to either increasing or decreasing pattern of clinical predictors. The primary thrust of this paper is to address such clinical questions using a Cox Regression Model with isotonic regressors with such change-point problems. In a case study with multiple myeloma the impact of such change- point patterns of clinically significant predictors such as hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen, white blood corpuscles, platelets on patients median survival time have been explored. Policy makers in Denmark are starting to realize that RCT designs are needed if they want to know the impact of social interventions. Therefore the Ministry of Social Affair granted funding to do three RCTs of family programs (Multidimension Treatment Foster Care-MTFC, Parent Management Training Oregon -PMTO and Multisystemic Therapy-MST). During the last year SFI has been planning the studies including all relevant parts in the process. The process has been long and challenging. Problems faced include: 1: A pronounced resistance to randomization within all levels of social services. 2: An economic crisis in the municipalities causing both unwillingness to participate in the research study and a significant lower caseload in the MST and MTFC teams. 3: Fear of the study going to steal half of the families from the programs. 4: Underfunding of the studies. 5: Resistance against using standardized tests because this is not common in social work, and 6: Difficulties in getting data for power calculations. Recurring issues that we have had to deal with are: ""do we really have to randomize? Can't we just do some kind of matching?"" and ""it would be much better to spend the money on a wider implementation of the program and practice oriented qualitative research."" Recently the MST study was cancelled since all five MST teams declined to participate. Funding was transferred to the other two studies making them look more promising. A lot of resources have been used to prepare the studies and expectations are high. Hopefully by May 2012 the MTFC study will be recruiting families and the PMTO study will be ready to start recruiting in September 2012. If all goes well the two studies will be among the first RCTs carried out on social interventions in Denmark. Regulatory goals for a clinical study can be different from research and exploratory goals. For the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Phase 3 Investigational New Drug (IND) studies (i.e., adequate and well- controlled studies) will provide the primary clinical evidence to support a marketing application such as a Biologic License Application (BLA). To support approval and initiation of these studies, the protocol should cover all the statistical issues considered by the reviewers when assessing the study design and its ability to adequately address the study objectives. As an aid to statistical reviewers, as well as to improve efficiency and consistency in our reviews of these protocols, the Division of Biostatistics in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) has developed a checklist outlining the important elements of a Phase 3 protocol. Some elements included in this checklist are consistency between the study objectives and endpoints; number and regions of study sites; statistical hypotheses; planned interim analyses; sample size assumptions and calculations; randomization description; blinding techniques; analysis populations; multiplicity considerations; missing data considerations; study success criterion; and study conduct. Original IND submissions with protocols with such elements may also lead to less correspondence with the sponsor to clarify items in the protocol. We note that the elements identified in this checklist may also be helpful in designing earlier phase studies as well as non-IND studies. This presentation will focus on the motivation, contents, and use of the checklist. In non-inferiority trials, a pre-specified margin of non-inferiority must be defined a priori. However, what happens when an acceptable risk varies according to physician risk tolerance or patient circumstances, so a pre-specified margin of non-inferiority cannot be easily defined? We will discuss a double-blind clinical trial in which SLE patients on long-term MMF therapy with stable disease are randomized to continue therapy or withdraw. It is expected that withdrawal from MMF will result in increased risk of disease reactivation; however, long- term MMF treatment is not without risk of side effects. The goal of the trial is to determine if the increase in risk of disease reactivation outweighs the benefits of withdrawal. One could frame this goal as a test of the non-inferiority hypothesis that the increased risk of disease reactivation is greater than a pre-specified margin, determined by potential benefit. However, how the risks and benefits should be weighed is highly individual, even for experienced rheumatologists. Rather than design the study to test a hypothesis of non- inferiority using an arbitrary risk margin that may or may not be relevant for any particular patient, the results of this trial will be reported as effect estimates for change in risk of disease reactivation in addition to other disease activity, safety, quality of life and medication use endpoints. These effect estimates and confidence intervals will describe the risks and benefits of withdrawal from study therapy and may be used to guide physicians and patients in making decisions based on individualized assessments of acceptable risk. As clinicians are likely to find interpretation of results difficult in the absence of hypothesis testing (and p-values), we will discuss the approach planned for disseminating clinical trial results. Cluster randomised trials (CRTs), compared to individually randomised trials, require specific analysis; statistical models need to take account of between-cluster variability. This abstract focuses on two main approaches to analysis, cluster-level (CL) and individual-level (IL), and examines their efficiency for the Training Caregivers After Stroke trial (TRACS). TRACS is a CRT evaluating a complex intervention in stroke rehabilitation with 928 dyads of patients and caregivers within 36 stoke rehabilitation units. The primary outcome is NEADL score at 6 months. CL analysis is attractive due to its simplicity. We compare performance of three techniques; simple summaries (using appropriate two- sample weighted t-tests), CL analysis adjusted for covariates and nonparametric methods. The CL approach is a two-stage method; in unadjusted analysis, a summary measure for each cluster is calculated and two sets of cluster-specific measures are compared using the weighted t-test. When performing CL analysis adjusted for covariates; we carried out an IL regression with all but intervention effect covariates ignoring the clustering effect. Secondly, we compared the residuals for each cluster between treatment arms using the weighted two-sample t-test. Wilcoxon's rank sum test was used as a nonparametric substitute to the two-sample t- test. IL analysis, using a random effects linear mixed model with stroke rehabilitation units as level 2, was the preferred method, because of its greater computational convenience and it is possible to analyse the intervention effect and other covariates simultaneously. The CL approach is robust, particularly for a smaller number of clusters. However, it may not be statistically the most efficient, especially if clusters are of varying size. Such weighting is incorporated in IL analysis. Analysis of cluster randomised trials can be undertaken in a number of ways. We will present and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each of these analytical methods. Simple randomisation is the easiest method for allocating participants to treatment groups in clinical trials. In the long run it balances all features of participants across the groups but may not be suitable for small to medium sized trials, or for larger trials at the time of interim analysis. If important prognostic factors are identified at the design stage then minimisation can help to balance these features. There is uncertainty as to whether treatment groups need to be balanced at baseline, but many researchers believe this to be advantageous, allowing comparison between groups without the need for sophisticated analysis. Balance between treatment groups can be desirable in a range of scenarios: for small trials, interim analyses, early termination, analysis of subgroups or where the credibility of an unbalanced trial is considered problematic (e.g. in the case of a small treatment effect). Three completed trials of varying size, originally using minimisation as method of treatment allocation, were ""re-randomised"", in the order that participants joined the study, using simple randomisation. Datasets frozen at the time of either interim or full analysis were used. For all three trials treatment allocation was well balanced across prognostic variables and between treatment arms when using minimisation at all time points, i.e. for any number of participants recruited at that time. With simple randomisation, at each timepoint imbalances were identified that could have made analysis more difficult. In some cases the potential imbalance across treatment groups within a factor reached 100% (where all participants with a given characteristic were in the same treatment allocation group) and no amount of sophisticated analysis could compensate for this. The simulations demonstrated the need for incorporating minimisation into the randomisation algorithm of trials of any size in order to achieve treatment balance which cannot be achieved by using simple randomisation alone. A futility analysis is commonly utilized in clinical trials for early read of trial efficacy data. An investigational drug will be declared futile if the prespecified futility boundary is met, and the trial will be stopped. In a conventional group sequential design, a futility boundary is selected based on power preservation or sufficient conditional power, which protects the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis at the end of a trial. However, the observed treatment effect size is of increasing importance beyond rejecting the null hypothesis and is directly associated with the eventual success of drug development. To ensure a high probability of observing a desired effect size, or in another words a high probability of success, we propose a new futility analysis design approach where the futility boundary is selected based on preserving the probability of success. We define the relative preservation of this probability as ""pseudo-power"", using which we propose the boundary selection criteria. Via a case study, we evaluate various operational characteristic of this approach in term of the probability of correct and incorrect stopping, with respect to the futility boundary, the underlying true effect size and the timing of the futility analysis. Increasingly, the NIH and Industry sponsors are establishing large multi-center collaborative research efforts that implement multiple studies simultaneously through a network of investigators. This presents a challenge for the sponsors and leadership teams who are responsible for monitoring activities across studies. The business world has addressed this need for complex information monitoring systems with a high- level summarized overview called a dashboard. We created a web-based dashboard for the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC), a large, federally-funded, multi-center research consortium. The consortium has eight active studies that are being conducted across ten clinical centers with total projected enrollment of over 3500 participants. Many research programs provide web-based resources to aid stakeholders with study supervision. Unfortunately, traditional study portals can be hindered by an overabundance of information and tedious top-down navigation. These characteristics make them an inefficient resource for large multi-center programs. Our dashboard avoids the typical information- dense, hierarchical construction of traditional websites in favor of a comprehensive single- webpage display that is easier for stakeholders to access and use. Dashboards summarize and display critical information on a single page, with an emphasis on graphical, rather than text-heavy displays. Our dashboard has a main page for the consortium, which provides comparative enrollment graphs for the active studies, and displays pertinent deadlines and announcements. Each study also has a dedicated page that follows this same ""dashboard"" approach. We update the dashboard data weekly. Sponsors have responded positively to the ICAC dashboard, voicing appreciation for the system's efficient presentation of data and ease of use. Given the success of the dashboard, we plan to expand the system to other federal and commercial programs. Our experience suggests that multi-center or multi-study programs would benefit from creating a dashboard to provide sponsors and network leadership teams with key study monitoring information in a quick, succinct manner. Due to the lack of infrastructure in resource poor settings and despite the strong need for Clinical Research coordination, Information and Communication Technology has not been systematically and sustainably integrated into health research, hospital administration and practice, thus limiting efficiency and outcomes of the efforts to fight poverty related diseases. Cloud-based technology could now overcome infrastructure scarcity problems of resource poor settings and thus greatly support Clinical Research by integrating mobile, online, offline and Voice over IP technology. The Italian Inter University Consortium Cineca, a non-profit Consortium of Italian Universities for high performance computing and ICT, has an over 20 year experience in providing technological support to health research for activities related to the design and development of IT systems and services in the health care and biomedical area, using advanced technologies and methodologies. In particular, since 2008 Cineca has been involved in projects providing and developing technology to collect and analyze clinical and health related data in Africa. The European funded project Medishare, coordinated by Cineca, successfully managed to collect standardized data for over 15000 patients affected by HIV/AIDS, Malaria and TB in Kenya Tanzania and Uganda in one central database. Medishare was recognized supportive of the Millennium Development Goals by the United Nations. The Europe - Africa Research Network for Evaluation of Second-line Therapy (EARNEST) is a trial supported by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) that is successfully using Cineca integrated technology in Uganda, Malawi, Zimbabwe. Cineca exploits the integration of newer technologies to fill in the infrastructural gaps of Africa and provides a sustainable centralized infrastructure which is fully certified for quality, safety and security procedures. We have developed a LIMS to manage biobank samples for the Scottish Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (SERA) cohort study. Commercial and open-source solutions were evaluated and it was concluded that development of a bespoke LIMS system was needed to provide scalability and flexibility to support future projects with different requirements. The system developed includes a generic workflow which is capable of modelling:* Complex storage configurations with up to 1024 dimensions over multiple geographic sites * Storage rules for sample type, method and time of storage * Multi-event work flow processing from site collection to arrival at labs * Lab technician workflows incorporating working plate practices * Manual and automated validation methods using a combination of 1D and 2D barcode technologies The system is based on a tree structure; all samples are stored in a parentage tree that shows the lineage of the sample allowing for exploration of any number of generations of derived samples. Our tree based approach allows the LIMS to be largely generic. By defining the storage, site configuration and the collection protocols the system can operate with scenarios ranging from a single lab collecting ad-hoc samples, to a multi-lab, multi collection site protocol hosting thousands of samples.

Enabling Resource-Informed Decision Making: An Industry Perspective,"To assist in establishing a cost culture, the U.S. Army Central (ARCENT) Director of Resource Management (DRM) turned to the Army's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Cost and Economics (DASA-CE) for assistance in providing cost analysts to further his mission in Southwest Asia. Subsequently, in September 2008 CALIBRE Systems Inc. (CALIBRE) was awarded a contract to partner with DASA-CE to support the ARCENT DRM.

The New Cost Warriors,"The 2011 ASMC survey of Defense financial executives and managers looked at the Department of Defense (DoD) attempts to reduce costs driven by then-Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates. Defense cost management is done well or adequately In areas where costs actually mean something to someone Important, typically very senior leadership, costs occur regularly and routinely, and what Is being produced can be easily counted. Respondents described the attributes of an ideal cost culture: 1. foundation, 2. leadership, 3. expected behaviors, 4. continuity, 5. visibility and transparency, 6. options, 7. flexibility, 8. perspective, 9. tools and training, 10. balance, 11. incentives, and 12. risk management. Whether they are financial or other professionals, Cost Warriors have these qualities, say survey respondents: 1. understanding of nonfinancial issues, 2. communication skills, 3. the right mindset, 4. business savvy, 5. a make-do mentality, 6. understanding of related functions, 7. resolute and thick-skinned, 8. skilled in cost analysis, and 9. appropriately trained.",1069245529,,,Trade Journals,,"Crenshaw, Lewis, VICE ADMIRAL", AFCMAF, Department of Defense, Copyright American Society of Military Comptrollers Spring 2012,,, Feature,, Spring 2012," Defense , Warrior , Cost accounting , Cost",,0004-2188,2.0, English, English,, 8-11, Alexandria,Spring 2012,The Armed Forces Comptroller,2012,,57.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/new-cost-warriors/docview/1069245529/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aaccounting&amp;atitle=The+New+Cost+Warriors&amp;title=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;issn=00042188&amp;date=2012-04-01&amp;volume=57&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=8&amp;au=Crenshaw%2C+Lewis%2C+VICE+ADMIRAL&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",asmc survey financial executive manager looked attempt reduce cost driven robert gate cost management done well adequately area cost actually mean something someone important typically senior leadership cost occur regularly routinely produced easily counted respondent described attribute ideal cost culture foundation leadership expected behavior continuity visibility transparency option flexibility perspective tool training balance incentive risk management whether financial professional cost warrior quality say survey respondent understanding nonfinancial issue communication skill right mindset business savvy mentality understanding related function resolute skilled cost appropriately trained,"['asmc', 'survey', 'financial', 'executives', 'managers', 'looked', 'attempts', 'reduce', 'costs', 'driven', 'robert', 'gates', 'cost', 'management', 'done', 'well', 'adequately', 'areas', 'costs', 'actually', 'mean', 'something', 'someone', 'important', 'typically', 'senior', 'leadership', 'costs', 'occur', 'regularly', 'routinely', 'produced', 'easily', 'counted', 'respondents', 'described', 'attributes', 'ideal', 'cost', 'culture', 'foundation', 'leadership', 'expected', 'behaviors', 'continuity', 'visibility', 'transparency', 'options', 'flexibility', 'perspective', 'tools', 'training', 'balance', 'incentives', 'risk', 'management', 'whether', 'financial', 'professionals', 'cost', 'warriors', 'qualities', 'say', 'survey', 'respondents', 'understanding', 'nonfinancial', 'issues', 'communication', 'skills', 'right', 'mindset', 'business', 'savvy', 'mentality', 'understanding', 'related', 'functions', 'resolute', 'skilled', 'cost', 'appropriately', 'trained']",Feature,2,Management and Leadership
Team spirit,"Industry, military, aviation, air traffic control, and nuclear power plants all have developed team training initiatives that included crew resource management, leadership, situational awareness, and communication. The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School adapted and applied the concepts of crew resource management principles when training 220 staff members in the field of obstetrics. The program resulted in a 25.4% reduction in the Adverse Outcomes Index, a 13.4% reduction in the severity of adverse events, and improved overall safety and quality.2 Medical team training programs have grown, expanded, and been promulgated as TeamSTEPPS by the Department of Defense in collaboration with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the American Institutes for Research. Shackleton's leadership successes led me to reflect on leaders in my life who had The Shackleton Way3 including my past residency directors, Drs Richard E. Dean and Donald Scholten; my fellowship director Joe Civetta; Department of Surgery chairs Donald E. Fry and Russell Postier; and my mentors Dr Christine Grant, former Iowa women's athletic director, Dr Anna Ledgerwood, Dr Mary McCarthy, and Dr Mattie Horst.

Mega - Mobile Multimodal Extended Games,"As aplicações de entretenimento móvel têm hoje em dia um papel importante e significativo no mercado de software, abrangendo um grupo variado de utilizadores. Tudo isto se deve ao repentino sucesso de dispositivos de interacção inovadora, como o Wiimote da Nintendo, o Move da Sony e o Kinect da Microsoft. Por sua vez estas técnicas de interacção multimodal têm sido exploradas para jogos móveis. A recente geração de dispositivos móveis vem equipada com uma grande variedade de sensores, para além dos óbvios como ecrã táctil e microfone. Existem ainda outros componentes interessantes como bússola digital, acelerómetros, sensores ópticos. Os dispositivos móveis são também utilizados como máquina fotográfica digital, agenda pessoal, assim como para ver videos e ouvir música, e claro, para jogar jogos. Olhar para os novos grupos de utilizadores e para as novas formas de jogar e incluir nos jogos formas de interacção novas, usando os atributos e potencialidades de novas plataformas e novas tecnologias é pois um assunto pungente e deveras desafiante. Com este trabalho pretende-se estudar e propor novas dimensões de jogo e interacção com plataformas móveis, sejam smartphones, sejam tablets, que se adequem às mais distintas comunidades de jogadores. Pretende-se sobretudo explorar modalidades alternativas como as baseadas no tacto e vibração, assim como no áudio, combinadas ou não com outras mais tradicionais de foro visual. Almeja-se ainda explorar jogos em grupo, à distância e co-localizados, encontrando e estudando novas formas de expressão em jogos clássicos e jogos inovadores que envolvam pequenos conjuntos de indivíduos. A ubiquidade inerente aos dispositivos móveis faz ainda com que se tenham que encontrar neste jogos de grupo formas de fluxo de jogo que sustentem saídas e entradas rápidas ou menos rápidas sem que ainda assim se perca o interesse e a motivação de jogar. Este trabalho iniciou-se com uma pesquisa intensiva de trabalho relacionado, sobre a área de jogos móveis e suas multimodalidades, passando consequentemente pela acessibilidade inerente, jogos em grupo e suas formas de comunicação e conexão, e por último dando especial atenção a jogos de puzzle, sendo o tipo de jogo focado neste trabalho. Seguidamente, foi efectuado o levantamento de requisitos e exploradas as opções de jogo e de interacção relativas a jogos de puzzle móveis multimodais. No âmbito deste estudo foram criados três pequenos jogos sobre um conceito comum: jogos de puzzle. A primeira aplicação contém três modalidades diferentes de jogo: uma visual, apresentando um jogo de puzzle de imagens baseado nos tradicionais; uma segunda auditiva, que recria o conceito de jogo através de música, tornando as peças em pequenas parcelas sonoras da música de tamanhos equivalentes; e a terceira háptica, criando deste modo um puzzle com peças de padrões vibratórios diferentes. A segunda aplicação recriou o mesmo conceito de jogo, puzzle, no modo audio, mas retirando toda a informação visual, apresentando simples formas de interacção. A terceira aplicação apresenta uma abordagem sobre os jogos em grupo, permitindo jogar puzzles visuais e de audio em dois modos distintos: cooperativo, onde os jogadores têm de jogar em equipa de forma a conseguir completar o puzzle; e competitiva, onde os jogadores são forçados a ser mais rápidos que o adversário de modo a poderem vencer. Todas estas aplicações permitem ao utilizador definir o tamanho do puzzle e o nível de dificuldade, assim como escolher as imagens e músicas que pretendem resolver em forma de puzzle.",2925087670,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Carvalho, Jaime Miguel Santos Montalvão",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,

Bridging the knowledge gap between the Baby Boomers and the multigenerations,"In 2008, researchers were determining that the federal government would lose over half of their workforce, because Baby Boomers were reaching their retirement age. With Baby Boomers leaving the workforce in such high numbers, the valuable knowledge that they have acquired through the years will leave with them. This research was conducted to determine which method of knowledge transfer Baby Boomers perceived as most effective. Data were collected by launching a survey via Zoomerang.com. The multigenerations that participated in the study were Baby Boomers, Generation Xers, and Millennials. This study determined that formal (explicit) knowledge was perceived as most effective in the transfer of knowledge from Baby Boomers to the multigenerations in the U.S. Department of the Army. The results showed that the generations retained tacit (implicit) knowledge more and that it was most effective when they were being trained by Baby Boomers. However, the generations utilized explicit knowledge the most and perceived that it was most effective.",1271758049,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Rivers, Maggie",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2012," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Baby boomers , Federal , Government , Knowledge , Multigenerations , Transfer", 978-1-267-81604-7,,, English, English,,,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/bridging-knowledge-gap-between-baby-boomers/docview/1271758049/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bridging+the+knowledge+gap+between+the+Baby+Boomers+and+the+multigenerations&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rivers%2C+Maggie&amp;isbn=978-1-267-81604-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,researcher determining federal government would lose half workforce baby boomer reaching retirement age baby boomer leaving workforce high number valuable knowledge acquired year leave conducted determine knowledge transfer baby boomer perceived effective collected launching survey via multigenerations participated baby boomer generation xers millennials determined formal explicit knowledge perceived effective transfer knowledge baby boomer multigenerations army result showed generation retained tacit implicit knowledge effective trained baby boomer however generation utilized explicit knowledge perceived effective,"['researchers', 'determining', 'federal', 'government', 'would', 'lose', 'half', 'workforce', 'baby', 'boomers', 'reaching', 'retirement', 'age', 'baby', 'boomers', 'leaving', 'workforce', 'high', 'numbers', 'valuable', 'knowledge', 'acquired', 'years', 'leave', 'conducted', 'determine', 'knowledge', 'transfer', 'baby', 'boomers', 'perceived', 'effective', 'data', 'collected', 'launching', 'survey', 'via', 'multigenerations', 'participated', 'baby', 'boomers', 'generation', 'xers', 'millennials', 'determined', 'formal', 'explicit', 'knowledge', 'perceived', 'effective', 'transfer', 'knowledge', 'baby', 'boomers', 'multigenerations', 'army', 'results', 'showed', 'generations', 'retained', 'tacit', 'implicit', 'knowledge', 'effective', 'trained', 'baby', 'boomers', 'however', 'generations', 'utilized', 'explicit', 'knowledge', 'perceived', 'effective']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Methodology for engineering requirements for complex systems,"Many programs engineer inadequate top level system requirements resulting in increased costs, delayed schedule, large amounts of rework, and dissatisfied stakeholders. Ambiguous and incomplete performance requirements are the cause of many projects in DoD failing or delivering unsatisfactory results to the customer. The objective is to engineer a methodology for engineering system requirements into a minimal set of independent requirements that are complete, necessary, unambiguous, and verifiable. A number of sources have defined several characteristics of a good requirement, but none define how to measure all of the characteristics or how to determine if the set of requirements is complete. This research focuses on developing a methodology for engineering requirements to improve the system development effort. The key elements of this methodology are an engineering requirements process, a prioritization model, Requirements Maturity Level model, requirements engineering framework, and trade-off analysis model. These elements are needed to address the gaps identified during the literature review. The engineering requirements process includes high level steps to be performed and a template that can serve as a checklist. The prioritization model is a multi-dimensional mathematical model used to prioritize the capabilities and requirements. The priority of requirements is determined from the mission criticality of the capability it traces to and the effort to correct the requirement later in the life-cycle if it is not implemented correctly. The Requirement Maturity Levels (RML) model includes a means to measure the maturity of a requirement based on ten characteristics. Unlike Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), RMLs will be based on an interval scale that represents relative effort for achieving each of the levels. The system RML for the requirement specification is derived from the Requirement Maturity Level and priority of each requirement. The methodology also includes a Systems Requirements Engineering Framework which provides rules, guidance, and a meta-model to be used for determining if a requirement qualifies for a Requirements Maturity Level. The cost to fix the consequences of the unsatisfactory requirements increases dramatically over time and many faults are introduced early in the life-cycle and not corrected until much later in the life-cycle when it is more expensive to do so. Investing in systems requirements engineering may have an enormous payoff by reducing schedule and cost overruns.",1269757033,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Bijan, Yvonne",,, Database copyright ProQuest

Application and implementation of the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model at the United States Department of Defense (DoD),"DoD's supply-chain supports over 1 million uniformed, civilian, and contract employees, manages over $90 billion in inventory, and maintains some 15,000 aircraft, 300 ships, and 30,000 combat vehicles. The supply-chain is undeniably the backbone of DoD operations, ultimately enabling it to achieve mission success under a variety of situations. In recent years, the DoD has pursued numerous initiatives for the purposes of improving its supply-chain. Motivations to seek improvements (such as asset tracking, reduced errors, etc.), decreased costs, and increased responsiveness for the warfighter have been plentiful; however, measured improvement thus far has been difficult to ascertain. It is the intent of this research to establish a framework to enable DoD to use industry best practices and process improvements from the Supply Chain Operations Reference Model (SCOR) as a tool for Defense supply-chain modernization efforts. To accomplish this, the dissertation will address the following research questions: 1. How can the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model be adapted for use as an enterprise-level tool by the United States Department of Defense? 2. Once adapted, what barriers to the implementation of this new tool exist? 3. How can these barriers be overcome?",1176543056,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Arendt, Michael James, Jr.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2012," Social sciences , Department of Defense , Military logistics , Organizational change , SCOR , Supply chain , United States Department of Defense", 978-1-267-71983-6,,, English, English,,,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/application-implementation-supply-chain/docview/1176543056/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Application+and+implementation+of+the+Supply+Chain+Operations+Reference+%28SCOR%29+model+at+the+United+States+Department+of+Defense+%28DoD%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Arendt%2C+Michael+James%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=978-1-267-71983-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",support million uniformed civilian contract employee manages billion inventory maintains aircraft ship combat vehicle undeniably backbone operation ultimately enabling achieve mission success variety situation recent year pursued numerous initiative purpose improving motivation seek improvement asset tracking reduced error etc decreased cost increased responsiveness warfighter plentiful however measured improvement thus far difficult ascertain intent establish framework enable use industry best practice process improvement supply chain operation reference model scor tool modernization effort accomplish address following question supply chain operation reference scor model adapted use tool united state adapted barrier implementation new tool exist barrier overcome,"['supports', 'million', 'uniformed', 'civilian', 'contract', 'employees', 'manages', 'billion', 'inventory', 'maintains', 'aircraft', 'ships', 'combat', 'vehicles', 'undeniably', 'backbone', 'operations', 'ultimately', 'enabling', 'achieve', 'mission', 'success', 'variety', 'situations', 'recent', 'years', 'pursued', 'numerous', 'initiatives', 'purposes', 'improving', 'motivations', 'seek', 'improvements', 'asset', 'tracking', 'reduced', 'errors', 'etc', 'decreased', 'costs', 'increased', 'responsiveness', 'warfighter', 'plentiful', 'however', 'measured', 'improvement', 'thus', 'far', 'difficult', 'ascertain', 'intent', 'establish', 'framework', 'enable', 'use', 'industry', 'best', 'practices', 'process', 'improvements', 'supply', 'chain', 'operations', 'reference', 'model', 'scor', 'tool', 'modernization', 'efforts', 'accomplish', 'dissertation', 'address', 'following', 'questions', 'supply', 'chain', 'operations', 'reference', 'scor', 'model', 'adapted', 'use', 'tool', 'united', 'states', 'adapted', 'barriers', 'implementation', 'new', 'tool', 'exist', 'barriers', 'overcome']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement
Identifying operations research systems analysts' technical competencies: A Delphi approach,"After the attacks of September 11, 2011, the demands for more agile, adaptive, critical-thinking, and multi-talented U.S. Army Operations Research Systems Analysts (FA49s) have only increased. Tomorrow's joint operating environment demands U.S. Army FA49s to be ingenious, proactive, and multi-talented; proficient in their core competencies as military leaders as well as being proficient in their technical competencies as problem solvers in the operations research field. The purpose of this study was to identify the technical competencies and knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) required for future U.S. Army FA49s to perform their duties within the joint operating environment of the next twenty-five years. To identify these technical competencies and KSAs, this study employed a qualitative research design with a quantitative component using a conventional, web-assisted Delphi methodology. The Delphi study engaged 10 experts through a first round of data gathering through a web-based questionnaire. First round data was synthesized and sent to the experts, seeking consensus, during a subsequent second round. Expert consensus was achieved on the second round, precluding the need for subsequent rounds to reach consensus. The study resulted in the experts' identification and consensus on 5 technical competencies, 21 areas of knowledge, 41 skills, and 22 abilities that are required for future U.S. Army FA49s to perform their duties within the joint operating environment of the next twenty-five years. This research made four significant contributions to the engineering management discipline. First, it has added to the existing body of knowledge in engineering management theory and methodology by presenting and substantiating that a Delphi process is capable of identifying future and/or forecasting requirements. Second, it contributed to the literature by providing a basis for the expansion of the domain of competencies and KSAs for operations research. Third, this research contributed to the identification of competencies and KSAs that are germane to the practical development of military FA49 educational curricula and may be germane to the practical development of engineering management curricula. Fourth, this research has suggested directions for future research to enhance understanding of the competencies, knowledge, skills, and abilities for the operations research field.",1124899357,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Winklbauer, William T.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2012," Applied sciences , Systems analysts , Technical competency , U.S. Army", 978-1-267-64958-4,,, English, English,,,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/identifying-operations-research-systems-analysts/docview/1124899357/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Identifying+operations+research+systems+analysts%27+technical+competencies%3A+A+Delphi+approach&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Winklbauer%2C+William+T.&amp;isbn=978-1-267-64958-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,attack september demand agile adaptive army operation system analyst increased tomorrow joint operating environment demand army ingenious proactive proficient core competency leader well proficient technical competency problem solver operation field purpose identify technical competency knowledge skill ability ksas required future army perform duty within joint operating environment next year identify technical competency ksas employed qualitative design quantitative component using conventional delphi delphi engaged expert first round gathering questionnaire first round synthesized sent expert seeking consensus subsequent second round expert consensus achieved second round precluding need subsequent round reach consensus resulted expert identification consensus technical competency area knowledge skill ability required future army perform duty within joint operating environment next year made four significant contribution engineering management discipline first added existing body knowledge engineering management theory presenting substantiating delphi process capable identifying future forecasting requirement second contributed literature providing basis expansion domain competency ksas operation third contributed identification competency ksas germane practical development educational curriculum may germane practical development engineering management curriculum fourth suggested direction future enhance understanding competency knowledge skill ability operation field,"['attacks', 'september', 'demands', 'agile', 'adaptive', 'army', 'operations', 'systems', 'analysts', 'increased', 'tomorrow', 'joint', 'operating', 'environment', 'demands', 'army', 'ingenious', 'proactive', 'proficient', 'core', 'competencies', 'leaders', 'well', 'proficient', 'technical', 'competencies', 'problem', 'solvers', 'operations', 'field', 'purpose', 'identify', 'technical', 'competencies', 'knowledge', 'skills', 'abilities', 'ksas', 'required', 'future', 'army', 'perform', 'duties', 'within', 'joint', 'operating', 'environment', 'next', 'years', 'identify', 'technical', 'competencies', 'ksas', 'employed', 'qualitative', 'design', 'quantitative', 'component', 'using', 'conventional', 'delphi', 'delphi', 'engaged', 'experts', 'first', 'round', 'data', 'gathering', 'questionnaire', 'first', 'round', 'data', 'synthesized', 'sent', 'experts', 'seeking', 'consensus', 'subsequent', 'second', 'round', 'expert', 'consensus', 'achieved', 'second', 'round', 'precluding', 'need', 'subsequent', 'rounds', 'reach', 'consensus', 'resulted', 'experts', 'identification', 'consensus', 'technical', 'competencies', 'areas', 'knowledge', 'skills', 'abilities', 'required', 'future', 'army', 'perform', 'duties', 'within', 'joint', 'operating', 'environment', 'next', 'years', 'made', 'four', 'significant', 'contributions', 'engineering', 'management', 'discipline', 'first', 'added', 'existing', 'body', 'knowledge', 'engineering', 'management', 'theory', 'presenting', 'substantiating', 'delphi', 'process', 'capable', 'identifying', 'future', 'forecasting', 'requirements', 'second', 'contributed', 'literature', 'providing', 'basis', 'expansion', 'domain', 'competencies', 'ksas', 'operations', 'third', 'contributed', 'identification', 'competencies', 'ksas', 'germane', 'practical', 'development', 'educational', 'curricula', 'may', 'germane', 'practical', 'development', 'engineering', 'management', 'curricula', 'fourth', 'suggested', 'directions', 'future', 'enhance', 'understanding', 'competencies', 'knowledge', 'skills', 'abilities', 'operations', 'field']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Process Improvement
An Organizational Analysis of Strategic Sourcing in the U.S. Department of Defense,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) is the largest buying entity in the world, and a commonly cited criticism of the DOD is inefficiency in its acquisition process that leads to a high potential for waste. The purpose of this study is to explore whether the DOD's institutional setting and related bureaucratic structure prohibit leaders and policy makers from effectively implementing private sector best practices related to strategic sourcing that may help alleviate inefficiencies. Specifically, the research questions involved understanding whether existing DOD bureaucratic structure contribute to inefficiency related to sourcing and acquisition and the extent to which the DOD is able to effectively utilize private sector practices. A qualitative, case study research methodology was used to explore whether the DOD's institutional framework permitted the utilization of strategic sourcing processes. Gortner, Mahler, and Nicholson's theoretical framework and related argument that public and private sector organizations differ from each other according to three distinct mediums (legal, economic, and political) was applied. Interview data and document artifacts were fractured and coded, then grouped into categories using a modified grounded theory strategy. Key findings suggest that the DOD's current acquisition structure permits a limited application of strategic sourcing practices and the private sector's key success factors given certain political, legal, and economic modifications. More broadly, the study's findings imply that private sector practices and methodologies can be adjusted to function within the federal bureaucracy offering significant research opportunities. The positive social change implied by this research includes a more efficient use of taxpayer funds, improved service to the war fighter, and an opportunity to fund other agencies that are threatened by budget cuts.",1018559281,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Fallon, John W.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2012," Social sciences , DOD , KSFS , Organizational , Public-private sector , Sourcing , Strategic , United States Department of Defense", 978-1-267-34957-6,,, English, English,,,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/organizational-analysis-strategic-sourcing-u-s/docview/1018559281/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+Organizational+Analysis+of+Strategic+Sourcing+in+the+U.S.+Department+of+Defense&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fallon%2C+John+W.&amp;isbn=978-1-267-34957-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,largest buying entity world commonly cited criticism inefficiency acquisition process lead high potential waste purpose explore whether institutional setting related bureaucratic structure prohibit leader policy maker effectively implementing private sector best practice related strategic sourcing may help alleviate inefficiency specifically question involved understanding whether existing bureaucratic structure contribute inefficiency related sourcing acquisition extent able effectively utilize private sector practice qualitative case used explore whether institutional framework permitted utilization strategic sourcing process gortner mahler nicholson theoretical framework related argument public private sector organization differ according three distinct medium legal economic political applied interview document artifact fractured coded grouped category using modified grounded theory strategy key finding suggest current acquisition structure permit limited application strategic sourcing practice private sector key success factor given certain political legal economic modification broadly finding imply private sector practice methodology adjusted function within federal bureaucracy offering significant opportunity positive social change implied includes efficient use taxpayer fund improved service war fighter opportunity fund agency threatened budget cut,"['largest', 'buying', 'entity', 'world', 'commonly', 'cited', 'criticism', 'inefficiency', 'acquisition', 'process', 'leads', 'high', 'potential', 'waste', 'purpose', 'explore', 'whether', 'institutional', 'setting', 'related', 'bureaucratic', 'structure', 'prohibit', 'leaders', 'policy', 'makers', 'effectively', 'implementing', 'private', 'sector', 'best', 'practices', 'related', 'strategic', 'sourcing', 'may', 'help', 'alleviate', 'inefficiencies', 'specifically', 'questions', 'involved', 'understanding', 'whether', 'existing', 'bureaucratic', 'structure', 'contribute', 'inefficiency', 'related', 'sourcing', 'acquisition', 'extent', 'able', 'effectively', 'utilize', 'private', 'sector', 'practices', 'qualitative', 'case', 'used', 'explore', 'whether', 'institutional', 'framework', 'permitted', 'utilization', 'strategic', 'sourcing', 'processes', 'gortner', 'mahler', 'nicholson', 'theoretical', 'framework', 'related', 'argument', 'public', 'private', 'sector', 'organizations', 'differ', 'according', 'three', 'distinct', 'mediums', 'legal', 'economic', 'political', 'applied', 'interview', 'data', 'document', 'artifacts', 'fractured', 'coded', 'grouped', 'categories', 'using', 'modified', 'grounded', 'theory', 'strategy', 'key', 'findings', 'suggest', 'current', 'acquisition', 'structure', 'permits', 'limited', 'application', 'strategic', 'sourcing', 'practices', 'private', 'sector', 'key', 'success', 'factors', 'given', 'certain', 'political', 'legal', 'economic', 'modifications', 'broadly', 'findings', 'imply', 'private', 'sector', 'practices', 'methodologies', 'adjusted', 'function', 'within', 'federal', 'bureaucracy', 'offering', 'significant', 'opportunities', 'positive', 'social', 'change', 'implied', 'includes', 'efficient', 'use', 'taxpayer', 'funds', 'improved', 'service', 'war', 'fighter', 'opportunity', 'fund', 'agencies', 'threatened', 'budget', 'cuts']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Lean six sigma saves lives,"The mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicle is a huge (up to 14 tons), heavily armoured personnel carrying vehicle that has been used in Iraq to protect soldiers and Marines from attacks by crude but effective, homemade bombs known as improvised explosive devices (IED). In 2007, production of this vehicle was one of the highest, if not the highest, priority within the entire US Government. The Department of Defense (DOD) was responsible for managing the MRAP programme. By virtue of its ability to withstand attack by IEDs, which were responsible for 70% of the casualties in Iraq, the MRAP vehicle was quickly identified as a critical asset in modern warfare. To meet the ten-fold increased production goal and to overcome the subordinate challenges resulting from lack of a common vehicle design, SSC leadership turned to the proven process efficiency and quality improvement methodology they had heard about from other organisations within the Navy -- lean six sigma (LSS).",921993433,,,Trade Journals,,Anonymous, MASEDZ,, Copyright Institute of Management Services Winter 2011,,, Feature,, Winter 2011," Sigma , Lean Six Sigma , Save , Six Sigma , Iraq , Quality management , Lean",,0307-6768,4.0, English, English,, 37-39, Enfield,Winter 2011,Management Services,2011,,55.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/lean-six-sigma-saves-lives/docview/921993433/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Lean+six+sigma+saves+lives&amp;title=Management+Services&amp;issn=03076768&amp;date=2011-12-01&amp;volume=55&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=37&amp;au=Anonymous&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Management+Services&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Health Research Premium Collection, ProQuest One Academic",mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicle huge ton heavily armoured personnel carrying vehicle used iraq protect soldier marine attack crude effective homemade bomb known improvised explosive device ied production vehicle one highest highest priority within entire government responsible managing mrap programme virtue ability withstand attack ied responsible casualty iraq mrap vehicle quickly identified critical asset modern warfare meet increased production goal overcome subordinate challenge resulting lack common vehicle design ssc leadership turned proven process efficiency quality improvement heard organisation within navy lean six sigma lss,"['mine', 'resistant', 'ambush', 'protected', 'mrap', 'vehicle', 'huge', 'tons', 'heavily', 'armoured', 'personnel', 'carrying', 'vehicle', 'used', 'iraq', 'protect', 'soldiers', 'marines', 'attacks', 'crude', 'effective', 'homemade', 'bombs', 'known', 'improvised', 'explosive', 'devices', 'ied', 'production', 'vehicle', 'one', 'highest', 'highest', 'priority', 'within', 'entire', 'government', 'responsible', 'managing', 'mrap', 'programme', 'virtue', 'ability', 'withstand', 'attack', 'ieds', 'responsible', 'casualties', 'iraq', 'mrap', 'vehicle', 'quickly', 'identified', 'critical', 'asset', 'modern', 'warfare', 'meet', 'increased', 'production', 'goal', 'overcome', 'subordinate', 'challenges', 'resulting', 'lack', 'common', 'vehicle', 'design', 'ssc', 'leadership', 'turned', 'proven', 'process', 'efficiency', 'quality', 'improvement', 'heard', 'organisations', 'within', 'navy', 'lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'lss']",Feature,2,Process Improvement

"A Case Study of the U.S. Army Human Resources Command in Army Business Transformation: Measuring Psychological Capital, Resistance to Change, and Organizational Citizenship Behavior to Understand the Role of Positive Organizational Behavior in the Context of Organizational Change","This study measures psychological capital (PsyCap), resistance to change (RTC) and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) in order to determine the relationship among these variables in the context of organizational change. This is a case study of the U.S. Army Human Resources Command (HRC) that is primarily concerned with the research and application of positive social science, a rigorous form of social science that focuses on examining human goodness and excellence. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used in this study. The survey instrument included a forced-choice rating scale and opened-ended questions. A 66 item, on-line survey was administered to over 400 HRC employees. Ninety seven employees completed the survey. Data analysis confirmed all four hypotheses, i.e.: (H1) PsyCap is a construct comprised of hope, optimism, resiliency, and self-efficacy; (H2) OCB is a construct comprised of OCBI (organizational citizenship behavior towards individuals) and OCBO (organizational citizenship behavior towards the organization); (H3) PsyCap is a significant predictor of OCB such that if PsyCap grows so does OCB; and (H4) RTC moderates the relationship between PsyCap and OCB. The results of this study may be used to help organizational leaders improve workforce performance, increase effectiveness and efficiencies, and reduce resistance when implementing organizational change. Findings suggest that the promulgation and management of PsyCap within HRC may reduce resistance to change and increase OCB. Practical implications include a new means of increasing the likelihood of implementing organizational change at HRC. Future research recommendations include expanding this study to the Army at large and a longitudinal study of PsyCap, RTC, and OCB in the context of organizational change.",962405554,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Beal, Loyd, III",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2011," Social sciences , Case study , Regression analysis , Quantitative research , Path analysis , Surveys & questionnaires , Qualitative research , Change resistance , Human Resources Command , Positive organizational behavior , Positive organizational scholarship , PsyCap , Psychological capital , Resistance , U.S. Army , United States Army", 978-1-267-25011-7,,, English, English,,,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/case-study-u-s-army-human-resources-command/docview/962405554/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Case+Study+of+the+U.S.+Army+Human+Resources+Command+in+Army+Business+Transformation%3A+Measuring+Psychological+Capital%2C+Resistance+to+Change%2C+and+Organizational+Citizenship+Behavior+to+Understand+the+Role+of+Positive+Organizational+Behavior+in+the+Context+of+Organizational+Change&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Beal%2C+Loyd%2C+III&amp;isbn=978-1-267-25011-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",measure psychological capital psycap resistance change rtc organizational citizenship behavior ocb order determine relationship among variable context organizational change case army human resource command hrc primarily concerned application positive social science rigorous form social science focus examining human goodness excellence qualitative quantitative method used survey instrument included rating scale question item survey administered hrc employee ninety seven employee completed survey confirmed four hypothesis psycap construct comprised hope optimism resiliency ocb construct comprised ocbi organizational citizenship behavior towards individual ocbo organizational citizenship behavior towards organization psycap significant predictor ocb psycap grows ocb rtc moderate relationship psycap ocb result may used help organizational leader improve workforce performance increase effectiveness efficiency reduce resistance implementing organizational change finding suggest promulgation management psycap within hrc may reduce resistance change increase ocb practical implication include new mean increasing likelihood implementing organizational change hrc future recommendation include expanding army large longitudinal psycap rtc ocb context organizational change,"['measures', 'psychological', 'capital', 'psycap', 'resistance', 'change', 'rtc', 'organizational', 'citizenship', 'behavior', 'ocb', 'order', 'determine', 'relationship', 'among', 'variables', 'context', 'organizational', 'change', 'case', 'army', 'human', 'resources', 'command', 'hrc', 'primarily', 'concerned', 'application', 'positive', 'social', 'science', 'rigorous', 'form', 'social', 'science', 'focuses', 'examining', 'human', 'goodness', 'excellence', 'qualitative', 'quantitative', 'methods', 'used', 'survey', 'instrument', 'included', 'rating', 'scale', 'questions', 'item', 'survey', 'administered', 'hrc', 'employees', 'ninety', 'seven', 'employees', 'completed', 'survey', 'data', 'confirmed', 'four', 'hypotheses', 'psycap', 'construct', 'comprised', 'hope', 'optimism', 'resiliency', 'ocb', 'construct', 'comprised', 'ocbi', 'organizational', 'citizenship', 'behavior', 'towards', 'individuals', 'ocbo', 'organizational', 'citizenship', 'behavior', 'towards', 'organization', 'psycap', 'significant', 'predictor', 'ocb', 'psycap', 'grows', 'ocb', 'rtc', 'moderates', 'relationship', 'psycap', 'ocb', 'results', 'may', 'used', 'help', 'organizational', 'leaders', 'improve', 'workforce', 'performance', 'increase', 'effectiveness', 'efficiencies', 'reduce', 'resistance', 'implementing', 'organizational', 'change', 'findings', 'suggest', 'promulgation', 'management', 'psycap', 'within', 'hrc', 'may', 'reduce', 'resistance', 'change', 'increase', 'ocb', 'practical', 'implications', 'include', 'new', 'means', 'increasing', 'likelihood', 'implementing', 'organizational', 'change', 'hrc', 'future', 'recommendations', 'include', 'expanding', 'army', 'large', 'longitudinal', 'psycap', 'rtc', 'ocb', 'context', 'organizational', 'change']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
"The Congress and DOD Management Process: Space Acquisition, a Critique and Evaluation","Change has become the ""status quo"" for all levels of United States' governance; leaders in all sectors must be prepared to rapidly respond to global events such as: natural disasters, humanitarian relief efforts, acts of terrorism, peacekeeping missions, and daily movement of troops and cargo to far flung reaches of the globe. The Department of Defense (DOD) plays an integral role in the successful response to these events wherever and whenever they may happen to occur. It is critical to this country's national security that DOD lead research efforts to maintain the highest levels of defense capabilities in space (including cyber), in the air, on land, and on the sea. The power to meet the challenges of today and those that our country will most certainly face in the future is vital to our role as a world leader. A key element supporting that agenda is The Integrated Defense Acquisition Technology and Logistics Life Cycle Management System. It consists of the Joint Capabilities Integration &amp; Development System, Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution and the DOD Acquisition Process. The department acquires major acquisition programs such as, satellites, aircraft, tanks and major information technology systems using this established procedure. For at least the past two years, the DOD acquisition process has suffered major criticism from leadership at all levels of government for its inability to deliver required capability to the war fighter—on time, on schedule, and within budget. The fact we have been fighting three major conflicts simultaneously exacerbates the situation. The good news is that there are many initiatives underway within DOD and the legislative branch to vastly improve the acquisition process. The purpose of this paper is to focus research on just one aspect of DOD's acquisition the relationship between Congress and the DOD Space System acquisition process. It should be stated at the outset that this is a particularly propitious time for the Congress and DOD relationship; this is a time of growth and taking a new look at the ways that they interrelate with each other. This review is intended to examine the relationship from a perspective of social and anthropological theoretical frameworks, with particular emphasis on Symbolic Interactionism's (SI) articulation of the role of human symbolic process in the interactional construction of institutional and individual relationships. This particularized focus derives from the basic understanding that they, DOD and Congress, are rational human problem solvers, and that society is a process of individuals interacting (cooperating, role taking, aligning perspectives and acts, and communicating). In high frequency interactions, institutions, groups and individuals reaffirm constantly emerging structures and resource mediums within clearly understood and partially ambiguous outcomes. Specifically, this responds to the anthropologists' history of investigating and describing high frequency institutional, group and individual relationships. Humans engage in overt and covert actions in the present—recalling lessons of the past, planning for the future, and the dynamic interaction that takes place between them. These theoretical perspectives go a long way to make both functional and dysfunctional elements of this relationship transparent. Ultimately, once discovered and articulated, these elements can be seen to exert an important influence on the direction of individuals, societies, and ultimately on such vital and complex processes as that of the Congress-DOD acquisition process. At this juncture, the two professional involvements of engineering as normally conceived and the recent work of social engineering come together. Without social engineering, the problems of agreement on the complexities of budget, time, and appraisals of advanced military systems run into unnecessary but often lethal blockages where agreement, negotiation, and the smooth settlement of conflicts can render the best of groups' intentions dysfunctional. This analysis provides insight for those practitioners desiring improvements to the overall DOD space acquisition process. This study gives special attention to the ""human aspect"" of this process, as well as proposing an institutional relationship model for use in the DOD/Congress relationship and several of the many complex functions by which they can be evaluated. This investigation uses almost a century of sociological theory embracing the functions of discourse as a major source of evaluative perspective for the shaping of the significant relationships between one organization and another. This study does not represent absolutes but attempts to advance the investigation through research (Geertz, 1973). Previously discovered facts are mobilized, previously developed concepts used, previously formulated hypothesis tried out; but the movement is not from already proven theorems to newly proven ones, it is from awkward fumbling for the most elementary understanding to a supported claim that one has achieved that and surpassed it. A study is an advance if it is more incisive—whatever that may mean—than those that preceded it.

ARCHITECT: The architecture-based technology evaluation and capability tradeoff method,"The use of architectures for the design, development, and documentation of system-of-systems engineering has become a common practice in recent years. This practice became mandatory in the defense industry in 2004 when the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) Promulgation Memo mandated that all Department of Defense (DoD) architectures must be DoDAF compliant. Despite this mandate, there has been significant confusion and a lack of consistency in the creation and the use of the architecture products. Products are typically created as static documents used for communication and documentation purposes that are difficult to change and do not support engineering design activities and acquisition decision making. At the same time, acquisition guidance has been recently reformed to move from the bottom-up approach of the Requirements Generation System (RGS) to the top-down approach mandated by the Joint Capabilities Integration and Devel- opment System (JCIDS), which requires the use of DoDAF to support acquisition. Defense agencies have had difficulty adjusting to this new policy, and are struggling to determine how to meet new acquisition requirements. This research has developed the Architecture-based Technology Evaluation and Capability Tradeoff (ARCHITECT) Methodology to respond to these challenges and address concerns raised about the defense acquisition process, particularly the time required to implement parts of the process, the need to evaluate solutions across capability and mission areas, and the need to use a rigorous, traceable, repeatable method that utilizes modeling and simulation to better substantiate early-phase acquisition decisions. The objective is to create a capability-based systems engineering methodology for the early phases of design and acquisition (specifically Pre-Milestone A activities) which improves agility in defense acquisition by (1) streamlining the development of key elements of JCIDS and DoDAF, (2) moving the creation of DoDAF products forward in the defense acquisition process, and (3) using DoDAF products for more than documentation by integrating them into the problem definition and analysis of alternatives phases and applying executable architecting. This research proposes and demonstrates the plausibility of a prescriptive methodology for developing executable DoDAF products which will explicitly support decision-making in the early phases of JCIDS. A set of criteria by which CBAs should be judged is proposed, and the methodology is developed with these criteria in mind. The methodology integrates existing tools and techniques for systems engineering and system of systems engineering with several new modeling and simulation tools and techniques developed as part of this research to fill gaps noted in prior CBAs. A suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) mission is used to demonstrate the ap- plication of ARCHITECT and to show the plausibility of the approach. For the SEAD study, metrics are derived and a gap analysis is performed. The study then identifies and quantitatively compares system and operational architecture alternatives for performing SEAD. A series of down-selections is performed to identify promising architectures, and these promising solutions are subject to further analysis where the impacts of force structure and network structure are examined. While the numerical results of the SEAD study are notional and could not be applied to an actual SEAD CBA, the example served to highlight many of the salient features of the methodology. The SEAD study presented enabled pre-Milestone A tradeoffs to be performed quantitatively across a large number of architectural alternatives in a traceable and repeatable manner. The alternatives considered included variations on operations, systems, organizational responsibilities (through the assignment of systems to tasks), network (or collaboration) structure, interoperability level, and force structure. All of the information used in the study is preserved in the environment, which is dynamic and allows for on-the-fly analysis. The assumptions used were consistent, which was assured through the use of single file documenting all inputs, which was shared across all models. Furthermore, a model was made of the ARCHITECT methodology itself, and was used to demonstrate that even if the steps took twice as long to perform as they did in the case of the SEAD example, the methodology still provides the ability to conduct CBA analyses in less time than prior CBAs to date. Overall, it is shown that the ARCHITECT methodology results in an improvement over current CBAs in the criteria developed here.",926212016,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Griendling, Kelly A.",,, Database

Lean Six Sigma deployment: Improving Green Belt productivity,"This project examines factors leading to reduced levels of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Green Belt productivity at an anonymous U.S. Navy civilian agency. The Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control (DMAIC) methodology is applied to develop an action plan to achieve sustainable improvements to the agency's LSS Green Belt Program. Although a U.S. Navy civilian organization is studied, the challenges identified in the study are inherent to LSS Green Belt deployments within private sector corporations as well as other local, state and federal government agencies. Key success factors that are critical to the implementation and sustainment of an effective Green Belt program are examined, and improvement recommendations are provided.

Assessment of methods for monitoring responses to river restoration: Riverbed and channel form changes,"On the Middle Fork John Day River (MFJD), a low gradient, meandering river in eastern Oregon, restoration includes engineered log structures intended to increase in-stream complexity and habitat diversity. Effects of log structures on riverbed topography can be captured through repeat topographic surveys, digital elevation model (DEM) of differencing (DoD), and aerial imagery. This study evaluates the (1) potential for remote sensing analysis, (2) effect of survey point density on DEMs, and (3) application of DoDs, in monitoring riverbed changes in the MFJD. An average point spacing and density finer than 0.50m and 1.25pts/m 2 captures riverbed complexities. Although elevation changes were expected to be minimal, DoDs revealed -0.9 to 0.5m elevation changes associated with log structure designs. Incorporating numerical thresholds into future monitoring survey methods will improve the modeling of MFJD riverbed surfaces. Monitoring riverbed changes through DoDs can inform improvements to future restoration design and the effectiveness of log structures.",884964532,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Tu, Denise Shao-Wai",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2011," Earth sciences , Digital elevation modeling , River restoration", 978-1-124-79445-7,,, English, English,,,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/assessment-methods-monitoring-responses-river/docview/884964532/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Assessment+of+methods+for+monitoring+responses+to+river+restoration%3A+Riverbed+and+channel+form+changes&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tu%2C+Denise+Shao-Wai&amp;isbn=978-1-124-79445-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,middle fork john day river mfjd low gradient meandering river eastern oregon restoration includes engineered log structure intended increase complexity habitat diversity effect log structure riverbed topography captured repeat topographic survey digital elevation model dem differencing aerial imagery evaluates potential remote sensing effect survey point density dems application dod monitoring riverbed change mfjd average point spacing density finer capture riverbed complexity although elevation change expected minimal dod revealed elevation change associated log structure design incorporating numerical threshold future monitoring survey method improve modeling mfjd riverbed surface monitoring riverbed change dod inform improvement future restoration design effectiveness log structure,"['middle', 'fork', 'john', 'day', 'river', 'mfjd', 'low', 'gradient', 'meandering', 'river', 'eastern', 'oregon', 'restoration', 'includes', 'engineered', 'log', 'structures', 'intended', 'increase', 'complexity', 'habitat', 'diversity', 'effects', 'log', 'structures', 'riverbed', 'topography', 'captured', 'repeat', 'topographic', 'surveys', 'digital', 'elevation', 'model', 'dem', 'differencing', 'aerial', 'imagery', 'evaluates', 'potential', 'remote', 'sensing', 'effect', 'survey', 'point', 'density', 'dems', 'application', 'dods', 'monitoring', 'riverbed', 'changes', 'mfjd', 'average', 'point', 'spacing', 'density', 'finer', 'captures', 'riverbed', 'complexities', 'although', 'elevation', 'changes', 'expected', 'minimal', 'dods', 'revealed', 'elevation', 'changes', 'associated', 'log', 'structure', 'designs', 'incorporating', 'numerical', 'thresholds', 'future', 'monitoring', 'survey', 'methods', 'improve', 'modeling', 'mfjd', 'riverbed', 'surfaces', 'monitoring', 'riverbed', 'changes', 'dods', 'inform', 'improvements', 'future', 'restoration', 'design', 'effectiveness', 'log', 'structures']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
"Development of Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities as Core Competencies for Technology Protection Professionals","The United States invests billions of dollars annually developing new technologies to maintain military superiority and economic competitiveness. The Research and Technology Protection (RTP) field emerged to protect these significant investments from inappropriate disclosure. Government agencies such as the Department of Defense (DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had not developed a standardized set of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) as criteria to hire, train, and develop individuals responsible for conducting RTP programs and activities. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore subject matter expert perspectives and identify the KSAs they perceived as required for RTP professionals. For the study, 10 technology protection subject matter experts served as panelists and completed 3 Delphi survey rounds to harvest their combined RTP knowledge and experience to identify 57 distinct KSAs organized into 6 domain areas they perceived as essential core competencies for the growing RTP field. The 6 domains consist of Protection Integration with 19 KSA items, Technical with 13, Security with 10, Program Management with 6, Counterintelligence with 5, and Foreign Disclosure and Export Control each with 4 KSA items. The minimum education level was determined to be a bachelor's degree, with a master's degree being the target educational level for RTP professionals. The panelists perceived training in the six domains as essential to provide RTP practitioners with the requisite experience necessary to demonstrate competency with each identified KSA item. Practical applications of the research include utilizing the KSAs established in the current study to assist in developing the DoD Security Professional Education and Development certification program, the Defense Security Service Academy RTP training program, and the Army Materiel Command technology protection officer qualification program. Recommended future research includes replicating the study in various academic and professional realms to continue the growth and establishment of the RTP profession. Additionally, future research could include the development of specific RTP training curricula for each of the identified domains and the development of a RTP-specific professional society and certification program for RTP practitioners.",883544323,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Averbeck, Ryan",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying

A quantitative study of military career transitions with emphasis in knowledge management,"The purpose of this quantitative descriptive study was to investigate three military transition services and two categorical variables, reason for seeking Army Career and Alumni Program (ACAP) assistance and education level to predict reasons for ineffective military career transitions. The problem of this study was the U.S. Army must pay states unemployment compensation costs if a soldier cannot transition to a second career or find a job, and sufficient research was not available to explain this phenomenon. The method was to design a survey instrument for this descriptive study to pilot and collect data from transitioning soldiers at a military base in Texas. The quantitative study included a demographic summary of 287 participants in the sample and combined 10 self-reported transition skills to create an unweighted soldier transition confidence index. The participants rated three transition services and the mean values for transition assistance program (TAP) workshop effectiveness, one-on-one counseling effectiveness, and adequate computer and internet services at the Texas ACAP center were 1.672, 1.923, and 1.878. Expected transition service performance, coded as ≤ 2, which corresponded to strongly agree or agree survey instrument responses, was an operational variable designed to test for a significant difference between this predicted outcome and the three transition service means. To establish a standard for measuring three transition services, this quantitative military transition study contained statistical tests using a critical value (α) = .05 to determine if there was a significant difference between expected transition service performance and the observed means. The findings indicated TAP workshops and one-on-one counseling services were effective and adequate computer and internet resources existed at the Texas ACAP center. This quantitative study compared the soldier transition confidence index means based on two independent variables, reason for seeking ACAP assistance and education level. The summary of the ANOVA tests confirmed there was not a significant variation in soldiers’ self-reported confidence levels with respect to the aforementioned categorical variables. The implications of this military career transition study are significant to the U.S. Army, the ACAP organization, human resources strategy, knowledge management, and leadership. A four-step military transition knowledge management model was proposed for future researchers and military leaders to examine military career transitions using a longitudinal approach.

"A framework for evaluating technology readiness, system quality, and program performance of U.S. DoD acquisitions","The purpose of this study is to characterize the current state of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) practice and enabling engineering activities within the DoD acquisition programs. Further, this study examines the extent of correlation between three constructs: 1) implementation of TRAs and enabling engineering activities, 2) military system quality objectives, and 3) acquisition performance goals measured by cost, schedule, customer satisfaction, and productivity. Although the DoD is a world leader in the acquisition of advanced weapon systems, over the past several decades the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has consistently reported that the DoD acquisition programs are experiencing difficulties as a result of advancing through the various stages of the acquisition lifecycle with insufficiently mature technologies among other constructs such as unstable design, lack of manufacturing maturity, and knowledge gaps. By means of policies, initiatives, and best-practices, the U.S. DoD has perpetually invested in refining its acquisition policies in an effort to curtail these risks. In recent years DoD has imposed assessment of technology maturity through the implementation of Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) on all its acquisition programs in order to mitigate these risks by capturing the right knowledge at the right time. However, there are a limited number of scholarly studies that evaluate the extent to which defense acquisition programs are implementing DoD mandates and best-practices that enable TRAs. Further, the correlation between TRAs, TRA enabling engineering activities, and military system quality has not been examined in a quantitative scholarly manner. In this study, a framework was developed to measure the relationships between DoD's TRA and enabling engineering activities, and U.S. military system quality. The framework was developed in conjunction with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from DoD, Intelligence Community (IC), and Institute of Defense Analysis (IDA), and empirically examined using a sample of 223 engineers, program managers, and executives from various U.S DoD acquisition programs. In order to capture the attitudes and experiences of acquisition engineers and Program Managers (PMs) in regard to technology maturity assessment, additional data was collected by structured interviews with eleven senior-ranking acquisition executives. Further, the data gathered from the interview subjects provides insight into how DoD organizations and contractors comply or fail to comply with TRA and interrelated tenets. The results of this study conclude that although formal Milestones B and C TRA emerged to not be significant in predicting the quality of U.S. military systems and performance of acquisition programs, various engineering activities that are examined during the TRA process were significant. Therefore it can be inferred that formal Milestones B and C TRAs may be of little value if due diligence is applied during acquisition lifecycle by adequately implementing engineering activities that reduce technical and programmatic risks.",862873381,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Azizian, Nazanin",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying

Building Information Management (BIM) Implementation in Naval Construction,"Traditional two-dimensional (2D) delivery systems in the construction industry can hinder the way information is communicated between owners, architects, and contractors. This hindrance exists in all phases of a project, from design and construction to the operation and maintenance of the completed facility. Building Information Management (BIM) is an emerging information technology that promotes a collaborative process for the Architectural, Engineering, Construction and Facilities Management (AECFM) industry; it can aid the exchange of information and provide improved project data accessibility to all stakeholders of a construction project. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), in conjunction with the facility management (FM) chiefs of the other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies, is committed to adopting the standards and technologies used in the private sector that promote efficient and effective business and construction management practices. The AECFM industry shift to BIM is resonating to the public sector and implementation plans to accommodate the shift are being developed by many public agencies at all levels of government. NAVFAC recognizes the need to develop and adopt BIM technologies in order to keep pace with private sector advances and has drafted a BIM Road Map document (NAVFAC, 2009) to provide BIM implementation guidance to the NAVFAC organizations responsible for providing and maintaining facilities and infrastructure to Supported Commanders. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the NAVFAC BIM Road Map , analyze BIM tools and processes currently used in the construction industry, and provide recommendations for best practices and improvements to the NAVFAC BIM Road Map . The methodologies used in this research includes three phases: Phase 1- evaluate the current NAVFAC BIM Road Map , Phase 2: Case Study and Phase 3: Develop recommendations to improve BIM Road Map . The outcome of this research effort will be a set of recommendations that ensure that all parties are clearly aware of the opportunities and responsibilities associated with incorporation of BIM into the organizational workflow for naval construction projects.",2674874885,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Rohena, Raymond",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Some aspects of the behaviour of pelagic species species off Angola and its implication on biomass estimation,"Pelagic fish off Angola constitute about 80% of the total fish landed and 75% of animal protein in the diet of the coastal population. In Angola, the primary means for estimating abundance of small pelagic fish is through acoustic surveys, a method that is sensitive to errors caused by effects of fish behaviour, particularly those that may reduce the acoustic detectability offish. This study describes the interannual variability of the fishery and stocks pelagic off Angola and their behaviour in relation to the abundance estimation. The dynamics of the two main pelagic species, Cunene horse mackerel and Sardinela spp off Angola differ. In recent years the biomass of Sardinela spp is at stable level, whereas the Cunene horse mackerel is at critical level. It was observe that a relatively straightforward analysis of conventional acoustic survey data collected at a single- frequency combined with ancillary spatio-temporal information can provide useful indications on the identification of single- and multi species aggregations of small pelagic fish. With regard to their behaviour, Cunene horse mackerel tend to concentrate in dense schools near the seabed, but at night they move into the pelagic zone, dispersing into widespread scattering layers. The present study found that under some conditions fish tend to avoid the vessel vertically, diving below 12 m depth as vessel was passing over the fish. In general, the results of this study should help improve Angola improve the knowledge of the behaviour of pelagic species off Angola and the quality of the abundance estimations produced.",2007525277,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Velho, Filomena Vaz",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2011," http://hdl.handle.net/10400.1/7737 , (UMI)AAI10598455 , Biological sciences , Applied sciences , Pelagic fish", 9781083614896,,, English, English,,,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/some-aspects-behaviour-pelagic-species-off-angola/docview/2007525277/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Some+aspects+of+the+behaviour+of+pelagic+species+species+off+Angola+and+its+implication+on+biomass+estimation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Velho%2C+Filomena+Vaz&amp;isbn=9781083614896&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,pelagic fish angola constitute total fish landed animal protein diet coastal population angola primary mean estimating abundance small pelagic fish acoustic survey sensitive error caused effect fish behaviour particularly may reduce acoustic detectability offish describes interannual variability fishery stock pelagic angola behaviour relation abundance estimation dynamic two main pelagic specie cunene horse mackerel sardinela spp angola differ recent year biomass sardinela spp stable level whereas cunene horse mackerel critical level observe relatively straightforward conventional acoustic survey collected frequency combined ancillary information provide useful indication identification multi specie aggregation small pelagic fish regard behaviour cunene horse mackerel tend concentrate dense school near seabed night move pelagic zone dispersing widespread scattering layer present found condition fish tend avoid vessel vertically diving depth vessel passing fish general result help improve angola improve knowledge behaviour pelagic specie angola quality abundance estimation produced,"['pelagic', 'fish', 'angola', 'constitute', 'total', 'fish', 'landed', 'animal', 'protein', 'diet', 'coastal', 'population', 'angola', 'primary', 'means', 'estimating', 'abundance', 'small', 'pelagic', 'fish', 'acoustic', 'surveys', 'sensitive', 'errors', 'caused', 'effects', 'fish', 'behaviour', 'particularly', 'may', 'reduce', 'acoustic', 'detectability', 'offish', 'describes', 'interannual', 'variability', 'fishery', 'stocks', 'pelagic', 'angola', 'behaviour', 'relation', 'abundance', 'estimation', 'dynamics', 'two', 'main', 'pelagic', 'species', 'cunene', 'horse', 'mackerel', 'sardinela', 'spp', 'angola', 'differ', 'recent', 'years', 'biomass', 'sardinela', 'spp', 'stable', 'level', 'whereas', 'cunene', 'horse', 'mackerel', 'critical', 'level', 'observe', 'relatively', 'straightforward', 'conventional', 'acoustic', 'survey', 'data', 'collected', 'frequency', 'combined', 'ancillary', 'information', 'provide', 'useful', 'indications', 'identification', 'multi', 'species', 'aggregations', 'small', 'pelagic', 'fish', 'regard', 'behaviour', 'cunene', 'horse', 'mackerel', 'tend', 'concentrate', 'dense', 'schools', 'near', 'seabed', 'night', 'move', 'pelagic', 'zone', 'dispersing', 'widespread', 'scattering', 'layers', 'present', 'found', 'conditions', 'fish', 'tend', 'avoid', 'vessel', 'vertically', 'diving', 'depth', 'vessel', 'passing', 'fish', 'general', 'results', 'help', 'improve', 'angola', 'improve', 'knowledge', 'behaviour', 'pelagic', 'species', 'angola', 'quality', 'abundance', 'estimations', 'produced']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Continuous Learning
Testing Software Development Project Productivity Model,"Software development is an increasingly influential factor in today's business environment, and a major issue affecting software development is how an organization estimates projects. If the organization underestimates cost, schedule, and quality requirements, the end results will not meet customer needs. On the other hand, if the organization overestimates these criteria, resources that could have been used more profitably will be wasted. There is no accurate model or measure available that can guide an organization in a quest for software development, with existing estimation models often underestimating software development efforts as much as 500 to 600 percent. To address this issue, existing models usually are calibrated using local data with a small sample size, with resulting estimates not offering improved cost analysis. This study presents a conceptual model for accurately estimating software development, based on an extensive literature review and theoretical analysis based on Sociotechnical Systems (STS) theory. The conceptual model serves as a solution to bridge organizational and technological factors and is validated using an empirical dataset provided by the DoD. Practical implications of this study allow for practitioners to concentrate on specific constructs of interest that provide the best value for the least amount of time. This study outlines key contributing constructs that are unique for Software Size E-SLOC, Man-hours Spent, and Quality of the Product, those constructs having the largest contribution to project productivity. This study discusses customer characteristics and provides a framework for a simplified project analysis for source selection evaluation and audit task reviews for the customers and suppliers. Theoretical contributions of this study provide an initial theory-based hypothesized project productivity model that can be used as a generic overall model across several application domains such as IT, Command and Control, Simulation and etc… This research validates findings from previous work concerning software project productivity and leverages said results in this study. The hypothesized project productivity model provides statistical support and validation of expert opinions used by practitioners in the field of software project

"Responding to Secretary Gates' Challenge to Eliminate Waste: The Time for a True Government/Industry ""Team Effort"" Is Now!","Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates recently challenged the Department of Defense Components to eliminate waste, cut overhead and bloated Pentagon bureaucracy costs, and reprogram funds for the warfighter. The DoD needs to launch a back-to-basics program. There is no reason to expend scarce resources in terms of time or money to re-engineer and procure additional financial, timekeeping, or budget solutions if existing operational non-legacy DoD system capabilities are already in operation. To achieve standardization, the DoD must develop a new, more rigorous initiative approval process that causes each DoD Component or activity to re-think any new development effort associated with unique dashboards, performance metrics, open government transparency reporting, and/or business intelligence tools. The Department should develop and mandate use of a consistent program examination methodology. Fix laws, policies, and regulations that currently inhibit progress or add no value. DoD leaders should apply the Warfighter Ethos of mission first to the Department's business challenges and assign accountability for achieving results.",848223648,,,Trade Journals,,"Del Mar, Debra S", AFCMAF, Department of Defense, Copyright American Society of Military Comptrollers Summer 2010,,, Feature,, Summer 2010, Government,,0004-2188,3.0, English, English,, 49-51, Alexandria,Summer 2010,The Armed Forces Comptroller,2010,,55.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/responding-secretary-gates-challenge-eliminate/docview/848223648/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aaccounting&amp;atitle=Responding+to+Secretary+Gates%27+Challenge+to+Eliminate+Waste%3A+The+Time+for+a+True+Government%2FIndustry+%26quot%3BTeam+Effort%26quot%3B+Is+Now%21&amp;title=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;issn=00042188&amp;date=2010-07-01&amp;volume=55&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=49&amp;au=Del+Mar%2C+Debra+S&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",secretary robert gate recently challenged component eliminate waste cut overhead bloated pentagon bureaucracy cost reprogram fund warfighter need launch program reason expend scarce resource term time money procure additional financial timekeeping budget solution existing operational system capability already operation achieve standardization must develop new rigorous initiative approval process cause component activity new development effort associated unique dashboard performance metric open government transparency reporting business intelligence tool develop mandate use consistent program examination fix law policy regulation currently inhibit progress add value leader apply warfighter ethos mission first business challenge assign accountability achieving result,"['secretary', 'robert', 'gates', 'recently', 'challenged', 'components', 'eliminate', 'waste', 'cut', 'overhead', 'bloated', 'pentagon', 'bureaucracy', 'costs', 'reprogram', 'funds', 'warfighter', 'needs', 'launch', 'program', 'reason', 'expend', 'scarce', 'resources', 'terms', 'time', 'money', 'procure', 'additional', 'financial', 'timekeeping', 'budget', 'solutions', 'existing', 'operational', 'system', 'capabilities', 'already', 'operation', 'achieve', 'standardization', 'must', 'develop', 'new', 'rigorous', 'initiative', 'approval', 'process', 'causes', 'component', 'activity', 'new', 'development', 'effort', 'associated', 'unique', 'dashboards', 'performance', 'metrics', 'open', 'government', 'transparency', 'reporting', 'business', 'intelligence', 'tools', 'develop', 'mandate', 'use', 'consistent', 'program', 'examination', 'fix', 'laws', 'policies', 'regulations', 'currently', 'inhibit', 'progress', 'add', 'value', 'leaders', 'apply', 'warfighter', 'ethos', 'mission', 'first', 'business', 'challenges', 'assign', 'accountability', 'achieving', 'results']",Feature,2,Process Improvement

DIAGNOSING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE BUDGETING SYSTEMS: A CASE STUDY OF THE U.S. NAVY,"We present here a case study of an organization within the U.S. Navy that created a new organizational construct and performance management system. We explore the issues faced by naval leaders as they attempt to use their performance information to make resource allocation decisions at the sub-organization level, and drive budgets at the organization and service (navy) level. We diagnose the practical problems a government organization encounters when implementing a performance management system, to include their influence on budgets, and make recommendations for public sector performance budgeting organizations. This case confirms challenges noted in the literature associated with performance management and performance budgeting systems. We offer recommendations for public officials considering such endeavors.

Exploring Methods of Improving Software Testing to Enhance Domestic Software Development Competitiveness,"In 2005, more than 36% of United States (US)-based software development was outsourced to foreign competitors. There is no indication that the outsourcing of software development has decreased since then or is likely to in the future. Such a large percentage contributes to the perception that the US is outsourcing its technological advantage. The purpose of this qualitative Delphi study was to identify improvements in software testing that would allow domestic software development firms to improve their competitiveness by improving the quality of the resulting software. A panel of experts was assembled to participate in the Delphi Study, each of which had a minimum of 20 years experience as software developers or as software development managers. The experts were from the commercial, education, and government sectors, including the Department of Defense. The experts answered questions from a survey developed for this study. The survey contained questions to determine theoretical concepts, practical techniques, professional skills, necessary tools, and management actions to improve the competitiveness of domestic software development projects through improved software testing. Numerous ideas were advanced by the experts. Architectural model designers need to incorporate testability into their releases. Statistical sampling could be used to generate quality metrics from happy-path and randomized software tests. Software testers must be provided with necessary skills, environment, and tools. Management needs to respect testing schedules. Due to the complexity of software testing, the role of the software tester could be specialized into architect, designer, implementer, and results interpreter. Software developers must take software testing seriously for the resulting products to meet the stated project requirements and schedules. If US software developers implemented the ideas advanced in this study, the quality of their products would improve, schedule slippage would decrease, and costs would be reduced. The number of outsourced software development projects would decrease as US-produced software products improve in quality, adhere to schedules, and cost less. Additional research could identify ways to improve other facets of software development, or determine what other market forces would reverse the trend to offshore software

Characteristics of successful collaboration in defense contract management: A study at Fort Irwin Army National Training Center,"Purpose. The purpose of this study was to explore the characteristics of collaborative governance in the contracting environment in the defense industries. The legitimacy and sustainability of a successful collaboration in a contractual environment are hypothesized to be dependent upon the clarity of the goals written in a contract, and the compatibility of both organizations—U.S. Defense Department acquisition personnel and private sector contractors—in core competencies, technology information, and accountability. This framework intends to provide insights into potential intervention strategies to enable more successful and collaborative performance outcomes. Theoretical framework. This research explores the underlying forces that drive the collaboration as articulated via transaction costs economics theory, public management theory, principal-agent theory, competency theory, systems theory, and collaboration theory. Methodology. The intent of this research was to build on prior DOD studies as well as numerous scholars’ works. The researcher triangulated the subject area using indirect elicitation and survey methods. In the indirect elicitation, the author used other researchers’ studies and findings to create a model linking the selected variables that correspond well with scholarly concepts and the grounded theories. In the survey, a questionnaire was sent to selective participants who were senior professionals from both government and industries, and who came from a mixture of technical and business backgrounds. A cross-sectional research design was employed to collect a body of quantifiable data on four major contracted programs implemented at the National Military Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California. Findings. “Sustainability of a collaborative relationship” emerges as a dominant predictor of the success of the contract in a simple regression model. The hypotheses regarding the building blocks of a legitimate and sustainable collaboration between DOD acquisition and functional personnel and DOD contractors are tested using the combination of difference of the means tests, measures of associations and simple linear regressions. Conclusions and recommendations. To maximize the success of the contracted programs, DOD personnel must maximize multiple instruments simultaneously; these instruments include a clearly drafted scope of work, technical competency of contractor, the availability of an information technology platform, and the collaboration among all involved participants. Furthermore, the scholarship of defense contract management should explore individual actions and decision values that guide both individuals and agencies so that they can maintain a less comfortable position of uncertainty through discourse and ongoing adjustments.",795219346,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Young, Kim Huynh",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the

United States Air Force reenlistment: Factors affecting a first-term Airman's decision to reenlist during a period of war,"The research presented in this dissertation offers an understanding of factors that influence an enlisted Airman’s reenlistment intent. The study explores the factors that influence a first-term enlisted Airman’s decision to reenlist in the U.S. Air Force during a period of war. Several factors, such as demographics and deploying in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, are evaluated to understand the impact these variables have on an Airman’s decision-making. The study is based on a survey administered to a population of enlisted Airmen stationed in southwest region with the results indicating which factors have a positive impact on retention, and which have a negative impact on the decision to reenlist in the United States Air Force. Furthermore, the research will show that the impact that factors such as deploying in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, an Airman’s marital status, and the number of years an Airman has served in the Air Force can affect an Airman’s decision. The findings of this study will be of greatest importance to supervisors, career assistance advisors and commanders of first-term Airmen to assist them in developing a mixture of the right career counseling, family and member support programs, and incentives to ensure first-term Airmen make the right decisions in regards to reenlistment.",763222277,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Branner, Redd R.J.G.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2010," Social sciences , Psychology , Air Force , Airman , Organization management , Recrutiment , Retention", 978-1-124-25639-9,,, English, English,,,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/united-states-air-force-reenlistment-factors/docview/763222277/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=United+States+Air+Force+reenlistment%3A+Factors+affecting+a+first-term+Airman%27s+decision+to+reenlist+during+a+period+of+war&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Branner%2C+Redd+R.J.G.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-25639-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",presented offer understanding factor influence enlisted airman reenlistment intent explores factor influence enlisted airman decision reenlist air force period war several factor demographic deploying support war iraq afghanistan evaluated understand impact variable airman based survey administered population enlisted airman stationed southwest region result indicating factor positive impact retention negative impact decision reenlist united state air force furthermore show impact factor deploying support war iraq afghanistan airman marital status number year airman served air force affect airman decision finding greatest importance supervisor career assistance advisor commander airman assist developing mixture right career counseling family member support program incentive ensure airman make right decision regard reenlistment,"['presented', 'dissertation', 'offers', 'understanding', 'factors', 'influence', 'enlisted', 'airman', 'reenlistment', 'intent', 'explores', 'factors', 'influence', 'enlisted', 'airman', 'decision', 'reenlist', 'air', 'force', 'period', 'war', 'several', 'factors', 'demographics', 'deploying', 'support', 'wars', 'iraq', 'afghanistan', 'evaluated', 'understand', 'impact', 'variables', 'airman', 'based', 'survey', 'administered', 'population', 'enlisted', 'airmen', 'stationed', 'southwest', 'region', 'results', 'indicating', 'factors', 'positive', 'impact', 'retention', 'negative', 'impact', 'decision', 'reenlist', 'united', 'states', 'air', 'force', 'furthermore', 'show', 'impact', 'factors', 'deploying', 'support', 'wars', 'iraq', 'afghanistan', 'airman', 'marital', 'status', 'number', 'years', 'airman', 'served', 'air', 'force', 'affect', 'airman', 'decision', 'findings', 'greatest', 'importance', 'supervisors', 'career', 'assistance', 'advisors', 'commanders', 'airmen', 'assist', 'developing', 'mixture', 'right', 'career', 'counseling', 'family', 'member', 'support', 'programs', 'incentives', 'ensure', 'airmen', 'make', 'right', 'decisions', 'regards', 'reenlistment']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Factors influencing intent to persist in higher education of participants in U.S. Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs,"The preponderance of research examining college student retention has focused on the influence of academic and social integration factors (Bean, 2005; Braxton, Hirschy, &amp; McClendon, 2004; Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 1980; Tinto, 1993). Recent research suggested that psychosocial factors may be significantly related to student departure decisions (Bean, 2005). In addition, the psychological construct of hardiness has been positively correlated to retention of students in higher education (Lifton, Seay, McCarly, Olive-Taylor, Seeger, &amp; Bigbee, 2006). The attributes associated with Communities of Practice (CoPs) may include many of the factors that might be considered psychosocial variables (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991; Stein, 1998; Wenger, 1998a). The function of CoPs is the promotion of individual and group learning that offered meaning and united members (Wenger, 1998a). The U.S. Army ROTC program offered a community of practice that encouraged learning through both formal and informal learning experiences and provided the social and psychological development variables that may contribute to retention. This study examines the extent to which the social and psychological variables, including hardiness, influenced the retention of participants in U.S. Army ROTC in higher education. Assessments measuring the variables were administered to participants in U.S. Army ROTC programs, and the results were analyzed using a logistic regression model to determine the probability of persistence in higher education.",758436316,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Johnston, Susan M.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2010," Education , Social sciences , Army Reserve Officer Training Corps , College student retention , Community of practice , Intent to persist , United States Army ROTC", 978-1-124-25874-4,,, English, English,,,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/factors-influencing-intent-persist-higher/docview/758436316/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Factors+influencing+intent+to+persist+in+higher+education+of+participants+in+U.S.+Army+Reserve+Officer+Training+Corps+%28ROTC%29+programs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnston%2C+Susan+M.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-25874-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,preponderance examining college student retention focused influence academic social integration factor bean braxton hirschy amp mcclendon pascarella amp terenzini tinto recent suggested psychosocial factor may significantly related student departure decision bean addition psychological construct hardiness positively correlated retention student higher education lifton seay mccarly seeger amp bigbee attribute associated community practice cop may include many factor might considered psychosocial variable lave amp wenger stein wenger function cop promotion individual group learning offered meaning united member wenger army rotc program offered community practice encouraged learning formal informal learning experience provided social psychological development variable may contribute retention examines extent social psychological variable including hardiness influenced retention participant army rotc higher education assessment measuring variable administered participant army rotc program result analyzed using logistic regression model determine probability persistence higher education,"['preponderance', 'examining', 'college', 'student', 'retention', 'focused', 'influence', 'academic', 'social', 'integration', 'factors', 'bean', 'braxton', 'hirschy', 'amp', 'mcclendon', 'pascarella', 'amp', 'terenzini', 'tinto', 'recent', 'suggested', 'psychosocial', 'factors', 'may', 'significantly', 'related', 'student', 'departure', 'decisions', 'bean', 'addition', 'psychological', 'construct', 'hardiness', 'positively', 'correlated', 'retention', 'students', 'higher', 'education', 'lifton', 'seay', 'mccarly', 'seeger', 'amp', 'bigbee', 'attributes', 'associated', 'communities', 'practice', 'cops', 'may', 'include', 'many', 'factors', 'might', 'considered', 'psychosocial', 'variables', 'lave', 'amp', 'wenger', 'stein', 'wenger', 'function', 'cops', 'promotion', 'individual', 'group', 'learning', 'offered', 'meaning', 'united', 'members', 'wenger', 'army', 'rotc', 'program', 'offered', 'community', 'practice', 'encouraged', 'learning', 'formal', 'informal', 'learning', 'experiences', 'provided', 'social', 'psychological', 'development', 'variables', 'may', 'contribute', 'retention', 'examines', 'extent', 'social', 'psychological', 'variables', 'including', 'hardiness', 'influenced', 'retention', 'participants', 'army', 'rotc', 'higher', 'education', 'assessments', 'measuring', 'variables', 'administered', 'participants', 'army', 'rotc', 'programs', 'results', 'analyzed', 'using', 'logistic', 'regression', 'model', 'determine', 'probability', 'persistence', 'higher', 'education']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Continuous Learning
Presidential executive orders and energy conservation in the United States federal government: An analysis of conservation methodologies in a Department of Defense naval hospital,"Due to growing concerns caused by high energy prices, oil crises and the threat of global climate change, several U.S. government policies are directed towards increasing energy efficiency and use of renewable energy. Two recent presidential directives, Executive Order 13423 and Executive Order 13514 address Federal environmental and energy performance and require that all Federal agencies set a good example for efficient energy use. In November 2009, some University of South Carolina faculty and students conducted a preliminary energy audit at U.S. Naval Hospital Beaufort, South Carolina to assist the facility management determine best locations to incorporate energy savings measures in order to meet the Executive Order goals. In order to demonstrate the relationship between policy development at the executive level and management of policy directives, this thesis assesses the effectiveness of Executive Order 13423 and Executive Order 13524 in achieving energy reduction in the Department of Defense. The use of Environmental Management Systems as a management framework for achieving compliance with the Executive Orders is also examined. Naval Hospital Beaufort is presented as a case study to show the extent to which the installation has met goals of the EO 13423 and EO 13514, progress made in recent past and how the installation plans to meet these goals in the future. Information gathered from the energy audit is used to provide recommendations on appropriate targets for energy use improvements in the installation. The expectation is that the results of the analysis will enable the hospital to make informed and appropriate decisions about implementing cost effective energy conservation measures to meet the goals of the Executive Orders.",746772541,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Egbue, Onanwa N.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2010," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Applied sciences , Department of Defense , Energy conservation , Energy policy , Environmental management systems , Executive orders , Federal government", 978-1-124-13565-6,,, English, English,,,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/presidential-executive-orders-energy-conservation/docview/746772541/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Presidential+executive+orders+and+energy+conservation+in+the+United+States+federal+government%3A+An+analysis+of+conservation+methodologies+in+a+Department+of+Defense+naval+hospital&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Egbue%2C+Onanwa+N.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-13565-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Health Research Premium Collection, ProQuest One Academic",due growing concern caused high energy price oil crisis threat global climate change several government policy directed towards increasing energy efficiency use renewable energy two recent presidential directive executive order executive order address federal environmental energy performance require federal agency set good example efficient energy use november south carolina faculty student conducted preliminary energy audit naval hospital beaufort south carolina assist facility management determine best location incorporate energy saving measure order meet executive order goal order demonstrate relationship policy development executive level management policy directive assesses effectiveness executive order executive order achieving energy reduction use environmental management system management framework achieving compliance executive order also examined naval hospital beaufort presented case show extent installation met goal progress made recent past installation plan meet goal future information gathered energy audit used provide recommendation appropriate target energy use improvement installation expectation result enable hospital make informed appropriate decision implementing cost effective energy conservation measure meet goal executive order,"['due', 'growing', 'concerns', 'caused', 'high', 'energy', 'prices', 'oil', 'crises', 'threat', 'global', 'climate', 'change', 'several', 'government', 'policies', 'directed', 'towards', 'increasing', 'energy', 'efficiency', 'use', 'renewable', 'energy', 'two', 'recent', 'presidential', 'directives', 'executive', 'order', 'executive', 'order', 'address', 'federal', 'environmental', 'energy', 'performance', 'require', 'federal', 'agencies', 'set', 'good', 'example', 'efficient', 'energy', 'use', 'november', 'university', 'south', 'carolina', 'faculty', 'students', 'conducted', 'preliminary', 'energy', 'audit', 'naval', 'hospital', 'beaufort', 'south', 'carolina', 'assist', 'facility', 'management', 'determine', 'best', 'locations', 'incorporate', 'energy', 'savings', 'measures', 'order', 'meet', 'executive', 'order', 'goals', 'order', 'demonstrate', 'relationship', 'policy', 'development', 'executive', 'level', 'management', 'policy', 'directives', 'thesis', 'assesses', 'effectiveness', 'executive', 'order', 'executive', 'order', 'achieving', 'energy', 'reduction', 'use', 'environmental', 'management', 'systems', 'management', 'framework', 'achieving', 'compliance', 'executive', 'orders', 'also', 'examined', 'naval', 'hospital', 'beaufort', 'presented', 'case', 'show', 'extent', 'installation', 'met', 'goals', 'progress', 'made', 'recent', 'past', 'installation', 'plans', 'meet', 'goals', 'future', 'information', 'gathered', 'energy', 'audit', 'used', 'provide', 'recommendations', 'appropriate', 'targets', 'energy', 'use', 'improvements', 'installation', 'expectation', 'results', 'enable', 'hospital', 'make', 'informed', 'appropriate', 'decisions', 'implementing', 'cost', 'effective', 'energy', 'conservation', 'measures', 'meet', 'goals', 'executive', 'orders']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Management and Leadership
Utilizing knowledge transfer to promote management of countervailing risks in value stream analysis,"Organizations are frequently faced with the challenges of modifying and streamlining their processes by utilizing the latest process improvement techniques such as Lean Thinking. They use these techniques to allow them to better perform their organizational purposes through the elimination of waste and non-value added steps. Personnel performing these modifications need to account for potential outcomes and risks when streamlining processes. An association of knowledge transfer and experience to the identification and handling of these countervailing or alternative risks when performing Lean Thinking value stream analysis is investigated. The elements of risk management, Lean Thinking and knowledge transfer are described. This dissertation presents the results of a non-experimental examination to identify knowledge transfer as a means to promote management of countervailing risks that may arise when performing Value Stream Analysis and provides a foundation for future research. A research model was formulated, and a survey instrument developed with data collected from Department of the Navy personnel during Lean Thinking events. Quantitative data analysis supported the research question and showed an association between a decision-maker's knowledge from other projects and the identification and handling of countervailing risks that arise during Value Stream Analysis.",741300981,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Temple, Jeffery A.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2010," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Countervailing risks , Knowledge transfer , Value stream analysis", 978-1-124-11306-7,,, English, English,,,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/utilizing-knowledge-transfer-promote-management/docview/741300981/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Utilizing+knowledge+transfer+to+promote+management+of+countervailing+risks+in+value+stream+analysis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Temple%2C+Jeffery+A.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-11306-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,organization frequently faced challenge modifying streamlining process utilizing latest process improvement technique lean thinking use technique allow better perform organizational purpose elimination waste added step personnel performing modification need account potential outcome risk streamlining process association knowledge transfer experience identification handling countervailing alternative risk performing lean thinking value stream investigated element risk management lean thinking knowledge transfer described present result examination identify knowledge transfer mean promote management countervailing risk may arise performing value stream provides foundation future model formulated survey instrument developed collected navy personnel lean thinking event quantitative supported question showed association knowledge project identification handling countervailing risk arise value stream,"['organizations', 'frequently', 'faced', 'challenges', 'modifying', 'streamlining', 'processes', 'utilizing', 'latest', 'process', 'improvement', 'techniques', 'lean', 'thinking', 'use', 'techniques', 'allow', 'better', 'perform', 'organizational', 'purposes', 'elimination', 'waste', 'added', 'steps', 'personnel', 'performing', 'modifications', 'need', 'account', 'potential', 'outcomes', 'risks', 'streamlining', 'processes', 'association', 'knowledge', 'transfer', 'experience', 'identification', 'handling', 'countervailing', 'alternative', 'risks', 'performing', 'lean', 'thinking', 'value', 'stream', 'investigated', 'elements', 'risk', 'management', 'lean', 'thinking', 'knowledge', 'transfer', 'described', 'dissertation', 'presents', 'results', 'examination', 'identify', 'knowledge', 'transfer', 'means', 'promote', 'management', 'countervailing', 'risks', 'may', 'arise', 'performing', 'value', 'stream', 'provides', 'foundation', 'future', 'model', 'formulated', 'survey', 'instrument', 'developed', 'data', 'collected', 'navy', 'personnel', 'lean', 'thinking', 'events', 'quantitative', 'data', 'supported', 'question', 'showed', 'association', 'knowledge', 'projects', 'identification', 'handling', 'countervailing', 'risks', 'arise', 'value', 'stream']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement
An investigation of supply chain management in the 21st century: A case study of supplier relationship management through strategic partnering with the Defense Logistics Agency,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) logistics mission is to ensure readiness and sustainability across the spectrum of military operations by providing responsive and cost-effective support. DoD’s supply chain is critical in determining outcomes on the battlefield. DoD needs to develop a supply chain management (SCM) strategy to enhance the delivery of goods and services to consumers in an efficient and cost-effective manner, as indicated in the DoD Logistics Strategic Plan for fiscal year 2000 (U.S. DoD, 1999). To support the future DoD logistics vision, DoD’s component organization, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), has taken the initiative to utilize supplier relationship management (SRM) to improve its SCM process. DLA is DoD’s largest combat support agency. It has nearly 22,000 personnel and provides the largest logistics support operation worldwide. DLA has eight supply chains that manage 5.2 million items, and processes a daily average of 54,000 requisitions and 8,200 contract award actions. DLA supports over 1,400 weapon systems and controls $94.1 billion worth of inventory. DLA’s mission to provide best-value logistics and contract management support continues into the 21st century. Analyzing DLA can draw conclusions on how the entire DoD can improve SCM processes by using the same tactics as DLA. The strategic tools used to meet DLA’s mission will continue to change as it implements commercial practices, reengineers business processes, teams with supplier business partners, and competitively sources agency functions. Also, DLA’s transformation process model will leverage DLA and commercial strengths to best support DoD’s Joint Vision 2010 and future war-fighting concepts and requirements. DLA’s ability to integrate the supply chain will be an added-value contribution to DoD. Initiatives, such as corporate contracts, long-term contracts, competitive sourcing, and joint ventures are some of the tools DLA will use to achieve supply chain integration.",738150215,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Whitehead, Bernadette L.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2010," Social sciences , Defense Logistics Agency , Strategic partnering , Supplier relationship management , Supply chain management , Twenty-first century", 978-1-124-09644-5,,, English, English,,,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigation-supply-chain-management-21st/docview/738150215/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+investigation+of+supply+chain+management+in+the+21st+century%3A+A+case+study+of+supplier+relationship+management+through+strategic+partnering+with+the+Defense+Logistics+Agency&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Whitehead%2C+Bernadette+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-09644-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,logistics mission ensure readiness sustainability across spectrum operation providing responsive support supply chain critical determining outcome battlefield need develop supply chain management scm strategy enhance delivery good service consumer efficient manner indicated logistics strategic plan fiscal year support future logistics vision component organization logistics agency dla taken initiative utilize supplier relationship management srm improve scm process dla largest combat support agency nearly personnel provides largest logistics support operation worldwide dla eight supply chain manage million item process daily average requisition contract award action dla support weapon system control billion worth inventory dla mission provide logistics contract management support continues century analyzing dla draw conclusion entire improve scm process using tactic dla strategic tool used meet dla mission continue change implement commercial practice reengineers business process team supplier business partner competitively source agency function also dla transformation process model leverage dla commercial strength best support joint vision future concept requirement dla ability integrate supply chain contribution initiative corporate contract contract competitive sourcing joint venture tool dla use achieve supply chain integration,"['logistics', 'mission', 'ensure', 'readiness', 'sustainability', 'across', 'spectrum', 'operations', 'providing', 'responsive', 'support', 'supply', 'chain', 'critical', 'determining', 'outcomes', 'battlefield', 'needs', 'develop', 'supply', 'chain', 'management', 'scm', 'strategy', 'enhance', 'delivery', 'goods', 'services', 'consumers', 'efficient', 'manner', 'indicated', 'logistics', 'strategic', 'plan', 'fiscal', 'year', 'support', 'future', 'logistics', 'vision', 'component', 'organization', 'logistics', 'agency', 'dla', 'taken', 'initiative', 'utilize', 'supplier', 'relationship', 'management', 'srm', 'improve', 'scm', 'process', 'dla', 'largest', 'combat', 'support', 'agency', 'nearly', 'personnel', 'provides', 'largest', 'logistics', 'support', 'operation', 'worldwide', 'dla', 'eight', 'supply', 'chains', 'manage', 'million', 'items', 'processes', 'daily', 'average', 'requisitions', 'contract', 'award', 'actions', 'dla', 'supports', 'weapon', 'systems', 'controls', 'billion', 'worth', 'inventory', 'dla', 'mission', 'provide', 'logistics', 'contract', 'management', 'support', 'continues', 'century', 'analyzing', 'dla', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'entire', 'improve', 'scm', 'processes', 'using', 'tactics', 'dla', 'strategic', 'tools', 'used', 'meet', 'dla', 'mission', 'continue', 'change', 'implements', 'commercial', 'practices', 'reengineers', 'business', 'processes', 'teams', 'supplier', 'business', 'partners', 'competitively', 'sources', 'agency', 'functions', 'also', 'dla', 'transformation', 'process', 'model', 'leverage', 'dla', 'commercial', 'strengths', 'best', 'support', 'joint', 'vision', 'future', 'concepts', 'requirements', 'dla', 'ability', 'integrate', 'supply', 'chain', 'contribution', 'initiatives', 'corporate', 'contracts', 'contracts', 'competitive', 'sourcing', 'joint', 'ventures', 'tools', 'dla', 'use', 'achieve', 'supply', 'chain', 'integration']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
Factors influencing organizational change in the Department of Defense,"This study explores factors that can influence attempts by DOD organizations to change their internal processes or policies. Due to its miserable implementation, the change process could have been abandoned as ineffective; but it is not up to individual employees to decide if it will take place. The transformation is being forced upon every organization in the market or in public sector environments, regardless of its origin, mission or any other factor. A combination of various (more or less) external changes literally brings organizations to their knees facing only two options: adaptation or extinction. This is where uncovering ways to improve the effectiveness of change process will prove to be invaluable. Without this knowledge, there will be many companies that may fail. Organizations that play a critical role where failure is not an option are primarily in the public sector, although recently federal government activities taking over major domestic automobile manufacturers suggest that private organizations may be too large to fail as well. Ensuring the existence of some organizations like the Department of Defense’s is especially vital. Unfortunately, most of the research targeting the subject of change has been carried out on private companies. This research focuses on change efforts undertaken in organizations in the U.S. Department of Defense to address this gap in our knowledge. The study design is a meta-analysis using existing research studies contained in the Center for Army Lessons Learned, an institutional repository for data from a variety of sources. This collection of information is gathered, analyzed, and disseminated in order to serve as a lesson learned for military commanders, staff, and students. The examination of change efforts undertaken within the past 30 years in the DOD conducted for this dissertation research is one of many examples demonstrating how the collected data is used. Information that formed the data set for this study was collected from a sample of 75 of the 183 case studies available through this electronic repository. A grounded theory review of the cases was conducted in order to identify factors that influence change processes. The presence or absence of these was established using qualitative coding methodology. Through a combination of inductive and deductive testing, a better understanding of key variables (leadership, people) has been gained and a causal model suggested describing the relationships between key variables and the effectiveness of organizational change efforts. The analysis presents four main research finding. First, I have identified common factors affecting change processes in DOD. These factors are quite similar to those reported in the empirical research on private and public organizations. This leads me to reject the hypothesis that the DOD is unique in their change efforts and that a generic theory of organizational change can be reasonably applied. Second, the role of the leader is quite important to DOD change efforts with evidence that a transformational leader is often the one in the position of leadership to manage a successful transformation of barriers into change enhancers. A third finding is that the even mix of barriers and enhancers or cases where there are more enhancers than barriers is more likely to allow change to continue and yield positive results. The opposite is true, if there are too many barriers, the change effort becomes stalled. Finally, while we cannot say with any certainty how barriers are transformed into enhancers, we can draw initial conclusions that this process will only occur when the barriers are explicitly identified and a problem set based on the situation is developed. The transformation can take many forms, similar to what could be expected from contingency and situational leadership theories. With the foundation of these four findings, I build a model that includes the variables observed to be the most common in the DOD. The model explicitly identifies the interactive process between the environment and the factors and where successful, the enhancers to the change process that are fed back out into the environment. This model suggests a learning process that can be iterative but that also acknowledges the dynamic role of the environment as a potential barrier or a potential enhancer at different times or points in the change process. While the limitations of meta-analysis prevent me from definitively describing a regularly used DOD approach to handle barriers and how they are identified and transformed into enhancers, it is clear from the case coding that some type of turning point is in evidence when change is moved forward and tends towards the desired success. The majority of the factors do not differ from those identified in the academic literature; however, an argument is made that their application in the military setting is not unique.

On optimizing the allocation of resources in project-based organizations: A public-sector case study,"One of the key challenges encountered by program managers in managing multiple projects within project- and program-based organizations is resource allocation. Although project managers typically work diligently to optimize the allocation of resources within the individual projects, using what are considered to be the best practices in project management, and thus leading to adequate and even excellent utilization of resources at the project level, such an approach may result in poor resource optimization at the program level. The unfortunate result is good intra-project resource optimization and poor inter-project resource allocation. In the long term, this can be very costly to the organization. In this study, a mixed integer optimization model (MIOM) was developed for the allocation of resources in multiple-project programs. Managers in a Department of Defense organization were introduced to the MIOM as a decision support tool for inter-project resource allocation. The efficiency of the MIOM for resource allocation was measured by collecting and analyzing data on four key performance metrics for a multiple-project public-sector program: cost performance index (CPI), schedule performance index (SPI), and mean square error of cost (MSEC) and mean square error of schedule (MSES) performance indices. The MIOM was implemented in a multiple-project environment as a decision support tool for the allocation of resources. The data collected were used to answer the overarching research question: What, if any, difference exists between the efficiency of project resource allocation prior to implementation of the MIOM resource allocation model and said efficiency after its implementation? Four hypotheses were tested to address the measures of resource allocation efficiency. The results of the analysis showed statistically significant improvements in each of those four measures after the implementation of the MIOM. Thus, the study provided strong evidence to support the conclusion that, on average, implementation of the MIOM resulted in improved project cost and schedule performance.",305206545,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Lari, Edward L.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2010," Applied sciences , Decision support systems , Mixed integer optimization model , Project management , Resource allocation", 978-1-109-74904-5,,, English, English,,,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/on-optimizing-allocation-resources-project-based/docview/305206545/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+optimizing+the+allocation+of+resources+in+project-based+organizations%3A+A+public-sector+case+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lari%2C+Edward+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-109-74904-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,one key challenge encountered program manager managing multiple project within organization resource allocation although project manager typically work diligently optimize allocation resource within individual project using considered best practice project management thus leading adequate even excellent utilization resource project level may poor resource optimization program level unfortunate good resource optimization poor resource allocation long term costly organization mixed integer optimization model miom developed allocation resource program manager organization introduced miom decision support tool resource allocation efficiency miom resource allocation measured collecting analyzing four key performance metric program cost performance index cpi schedule performance index spi mean square error cost msec mean square error schedule ms performance index miom implemented environment decision support tool allocation resource collected used answer overarching question difference exists efficiency project resource allocation prior implementation miom resource allocation model said efficiency implementation four hypothesis tested address measure resource allocation efficiency result showed statistically significant improvement four measure implementation miom thus provided strong evidence support conclusion average implementation miom resulted improved project cost schedule performance,"['one', 'key', 'challenges', 'encountered', 'program', 'managers', 'managing', 'multiple', 'projects', 'within', 'organizations', 'resource', 'allocation', 'although', 'project', 'managers', 'typically', 'work', 'diligently', 'optimize', 'allocation', 'resources', 'within', 'individual', 'projects', 'using', 'considered', 'best', 'practices', 'project', 'management', 'thus', 'leading', 'adequate', 'even', 'excellent', 'utilization', 'resources', 'project', 'level', 'may', 'result', 'poor', 'resource', 'optimization', 'program', 'level', 'unfortunate', 'result', 'good', 'resource', 'optimization', 'poor', 'resource', 'allocation', 'long', 'term', 'costly', 'organization', 'mixed', 'integer', 'optimization', 'model', 'miom', 'developed', 'allocation', 'resources', 'programs', 'managers', 'organization', 'introduced', 'miom', 'decision', 'support', 'tool', 'resource', 'allocation', 'efficiency', 'miom', 'resource', 'allocation', 'measured', 'collecting', 'analyzing', 'data', 'four', 'key', 'performance', 'metrics', 'program', 'cost', 'performance', 'index', 'cpi', 'schedule', 'performance', 'index', 'spi', 'mean', 'square', 'error', 'cost', 'msec', 'mean', 'square', 'error', 'schedule', 'mses', 'performance', 'indices', 'miom', 'implemented', 'environment', 'decision', 'support', 'tool', 'allocation', 'resources', 'data', 'collected', 'used', 'answer', 'overarching', 'question', 'difference', 'exists', 'efficiency', 'project', 'resource', 'allocation', 'prior', 'implementation', 'miom', 'resource', 'allocation', 'model', 'said', 'efficiency', 'implementation', 'four', 'hypotheses', 'tested', 'address', 'measures', 'resource', 'allocation', 'efficiency', 'results', 'showed', 'statistically', 'significant', 'improvements', 'four', 'measures', 'implementation', 'miom', 'thus', 'provided', 'strong', 'evidence', 'support', 'conclusion', 'average', 'implementation', 'miom', 'resulted', 'improved', 'project', 'cost', 'schedule', 'performance']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Management and Leadership
DoD's Financial Audit Strategy: THE WAY AHEAD,"The new DoD audit strategy focuses first on the SBR. This approach mirrors that adopted by the Department of the Navy and used by the USMC. It was chosen because the SBR is based upon the budgetary information that is the most relevant to day-to-day management of DoD resources. It is far more important than the considerations of property valuation that previously dominated audit readiness discussions, such as depreciated value or historical cost, both of which now are placed last on the list of priorities). In the private sector, asset values are critical for shareholders or investment analysts to value the net worth of a company, which in turn directly impacts the trading value of the company's shares; no such comparison exists for the Federal Government. Close behind the SBR in importance is to track the quantity and location of mission-critical military equipment and other assets as well as their condition and readiness. So the new strategy is driven by a desire to support the needs of senior leaders, both military and civilian, who need to know and manage the location and condition of physical assets--especially equipment required to support deployments.",304550018,,,Trade Journals,,"Easton, Mark E, CDFM", AFCMAF, Department of Defense, Copyright American Society of Military Comptrollers Winter 2010,,, Feature,, Winter 2010," Audit , Military , Financial audit , Finance",,0004-2188,1.0, English, English,, 12-15, Alexandria,Winter 2010,The Armed Forces Comptroller,2010,,55.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/dods-financial-audit-strategy-way-ahead/docview/304550018/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aaccounting&amp;atitle=DoD%27s+Financial+Audit+Strategy%3A+THE+WAY+AHEAD&amp;title=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;issn=00042188&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=55&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=12&amp;au=Easton%2C+Mark+E%2C+CDFM&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",new audit strategy focus first sbr mirror adopted navy used usmc chosen sbr based upon budgetary information relevant management resource far important consideration property valuation previously dominated audit readiness discussion depreciated value historical cost placed last list priority private sector asset value critical shareholder investment analyst value net worth company turn directly impact trading value company share comparison exists federal government close behind sbr importance track quantity location equipment asset well condition readiness new strategy driven desire support need senior leader civilian need know manage location condition physical asset especially equipment required support deployment,"['new', 'audit', 'strategy', 'focuses', 'first', 'sbr', 'mirrors', 'adopted', 'navy', 'used', 'usmc', 'chosen', 'sbr', 'based', 'upon', 'budgetary', 'information', 'relevant', 'management', 'resources', 'far', 'important', 'considerations', 'property', 'valuation', 'previously', 'dominated', 'audit', 'readiness', 'discussions', 'depreciated', 'value', 'historical', 'cost', 'placed', 'last', 'list', 'priorities', 'private', 'sector', 'asset', 'values', 'critical', 'shareholders', 'investment', 'analysts', 'value', 'net', 'worth', 'company', 'turn', 'directly', 'impacts', 'trading', 'value', 'company', 'shares', 'comparison', 'exists', 'federal', 'government', 'close', 'behind', 'sbr', 'importance', 'track', 'quantity', 'location', 'equipment', 'assets', 'well', 'condition', 'readiness', 'new', 'strategy', 'driven', 'desire', 'support', 'needs', 'senior', 'leaders', 'civilian', 'need', 'know', 'manage', 'location', 'condition', 'physical', 'assets', 'especially', 'equipment', 'required', 'support', 'deployments']",Feature,2,Management and Leadership
Joint -service integration: An organizational culture study of the United States Department of Defense voluntary education system,"The purpose of the descriptive case study with a multiple case framework was to (a) describe the organizational cultures of education programs and leaders in the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) voluntary education system on Oahu, Hawaii; (b) determine if an overlapping common organizational culture exists; and (c) assess the cultural feasibility of increased joint-service integration. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 education system leaders, including education service officers (ESOs); unit level education officers (EOs); and college directors from U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy education centers.

Optimizing the Decision Rule of a GPS Integrity Monitoring System for Improved Availability,"The Global Positioning System, which was created by the United States Department of Defense specifically for guiding munitions, has disseminated into many applications of the present. Using a differential, ground based augmentation scheme has enabled GPS guidance to be used for the ultra-safety requisite use of landing aircraft. The civil incantation of this project is called LAAS, for Local Area Augmentation System. The military desired a comparable system for their use, and has instituted the JPALS program, for Joint Precision and Approach Landing System. The object is to deliver an integrity monitor to satisfy the stringent requirements of difficult military operation. Although the distinction of emphasis might seem to be on the inherent danger of physical conflict, since the landing platform is expected to be distant from any combat, it is actually the electro-magnetic conflict which takes precedence in this thesis. The JPALS land-based, or sea-based, Integrity Monitor must be designed to endure radio frequency interference, RFI. The potential of RFI to undermine the operation of a landing system is quite real. The intrinsic obligation of an Integrity Monitoring System is to bound the errors associated with the guidance being provided. To this end, the system must determine if any of measurements are faulty, and if those fault(s) indicate the presence of a potentially hazardous position error. Hardware and software can be used to mitigate the impact of radio frequency interference to a GPS based landing system. Beam-steering antennas can be used to emphasize the satellites' signals, and to simultaneously deemphasize a jamming source. The focus of this thesis is in the software algorithms. How can we enhance the performance of our system in its robustness to interference, by optimizing the decision rule it uses to exclude satellites, and receivers, thereby maximizing the amount of useable information, and minimizing the error limits that are broadcast to the approaching aircraft.",2449657794,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Koenig, Mike",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2010," Global Positioning System , Radio frequency interference , Integrity Monitor , Electro-magnetic conflict , Landing aircraft", 9798678102669,,, English, English,,,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/optimizing-decision-rule-gps-integrity-monitoring/docview/2449657794/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Optimizing+the+Decision+Rule+of+a+GPS+Integrity+Monitoring+System+for+Improved+Availability&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Koenig%2C+Mike&amp;isbn=9798678102669&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,global positioning system created united state specifically guiding munition disseminated many application present using differential ground based augmentation scheme enabled gps guidance used requisite use landing aircraft civil incantation project called laas local area augmentation system desired comparable system use instituted jpals program joint precision landing system object deliver integrity monitor satisfy stringent requirement difficult operation although distinction emphasis might seem inherent danger physical conflict since landing platform expected distant combat actually conflict take precedence jpals integrity monitor must designed endure radio frequency interference rfi potential rfi undermine operation landing system quite real intrinsic obligation integrity monitoring system bound error associated guidance provided end system must determine measurement faulty fault indicate presence potentially hazardous position error hardware software used mitigate impact radio frequency interference gps based landing system antenna used emphasize satellite signal simultaneously deemphasize jamming source focus software algorithm enhance performance system robustness interference optimizing decision rule us exclude satellite receiver thereby maximizing amount useable information minimizing error limit broadcast approaching aircraft,"['global', 'positioning', 'system', 'created', 'united', 'states', 'specifically', 'guiding', 'munitions', 'disseminated', 'many', 'applications', 'present', 'using', 'differential', 'ground', 'based', 'augmentation', 'scheme', 'enabled', 'gps', 'guidance', 'used', 'requisite', 'use', 'landing', 'aircraft', 'civil', 'incantation', 'project', 'called', 'laas', 'local', 'area', 'augmentation', 'system', 'desired', 'comparable', 'system', 'use', 'instituted', 'jpals', 'program', 'joint', 'precision', 'landing', 'system', 'object', 'deliver', 'integrity', 'monitor', 'satisfy', 'stringent', 'requirements', 'difficult', 'operation', 'although', 'distinction', 'emphasis', 'might', 'seem', 'inherent', 'danger', 'physical', 'conflict', 'since', 'landing', 'platform', 'expected', 'distant', 'combat', 'actually', 'conflict', 'takes', 'precedence', 'thesis', 'jpals', 'integrity', 'monitor', 'must', 'designed', 'endure', 'radio', 'frequency', 'interference', 'rfi', 'potential', 'rfi', 'undermine', 'operation', 'landing', 'system', 'quite', 'real', 'intrinsic', 'obligation', 'integrity', 'monitoring', 'system', 'bound', 'errors', 'associated', 'guidance', 'provided', 'end', 'system', 'must', 'determine', 'measurements', 'faulty', 'fault', 'indicate', 'presence', 'potentially', 'hazardous', 'position', 'error', 'hardware', 'software', 'used', 'mitigate', 'impact', 'radio', 'frequency', 'interference', 'gps', 'based', 'landing', 'system', 'antennas', 'used', 'emphasize', 'satellites', 'signals', 'simultaneously', 'deemphasize', 'jamming', 'source', 'focus', 'thesis', 'software', 'algorithms', 'enhance', 'performance', 'system', 'robustness', 'interference', 'optimizing', 'decision', 'rule', 'uses', 'exclude', 'satellites', 'receivers', 'thereby', 'maximizing', 'amount', 'useable', 'information', 'minimizing', 'error', 'limits', 'broadcast', 'approaching', 'aircraft']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Management and Leadership
Information assurance within the United States Air Force,"According to the Department of Defense (DoD), a review of information assurance (IA) in the United States Air Force (USAF) in 2009, cyber security is jeopardized because of information loss. This situation has occurred in large part because of less than optimal training practices or adherence to training protocols. The purpose of this study was to determine if conformity to protocols was lessoned because of the current self-paced training regimen and whether or not trainees who spent more time on their training were correspondingly more likely to utilize security protocols. An ex-post facto quasi-experimental design and quantitative analysis were used to determine the training impact of current practices in establishing IA conformance to protocols in the USAF. Dependent variable data regarding IA training was collected from a sampling of military and civilian USAF DoD employees. Comparisons between user conformity levels to IA procedures after required training and between users’ perceptions of time spent in training and conformity to IA protocols, demonstrated that increased IA training time equated to an overall perceived greater understanding of both IA roles and conformance with security protocols. The results of this study have the potential to contribute to positive social change by helping the DoD understand the impact of some training dynamics on user compliance with IA protocols in the USAF cyber network. Thus, by utilizing the results of this study, the USAF could insure a higher level of user conformity with IA security protocols.",205432476,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Cherry, John D.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2010," Applied sciences , Assurance , Cyber , Department of Defense , DoD , Information , Training , USAF , United States Air Force", 978-1-109-70225-5,,, English, English,,,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/information-assurance-within-united-states-air/docview/205432476/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Information+assurance+within+the+United+States+Air+Force&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cherry%2C+John+D.&amp;isbn=978-1-109-70225-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,according review information assurance united state air force usaf cyber security jeopardized information loss situation occurred large part less optimal training practice adherence training protocol purpose determine conformity protocol lessoned current training regimen whether trainee spent time training correspondingly likely utilize security protocol facto design quantitative used determine training impact current practice establishing conformance protocol usaf dependent variable regarding training collected sampling civilian usaf employee comparison user conformity level procedure required training user perception time spent training conformity protocol demonstrated increased training time equated overall perceived greater understanding role conformance security protocol result potential contribute positive social change helping understand impact training dynamic user compliance protocol usaf cyber network thus utilizing result usaf could insure higher level user conformity security protocol,"['according', 'review', 'information', 'assurance', 'united', 'states', 'air', 'force', 'usaf', 'cyber', 'security', 'jeopardized', 'information', 'loss', 'situation', 'occurred', 'large', 'part', 'less', 'optimal', 'training', 'practices', 'adherence', 'training', 'protocols', 'purpose', 'determine', 'conformity', 'protocols', 'lessoned', 'current', 'training', 'regimen', 'whether', 'trainees', 'spent', 'time', 'training', 'correspondingly', 'likely', 'utilize', 'security', 'protocols', 'facto', 'design', 'quantitative', 'used', 'determine', 'training', 'impact', 'current', 'practices', 'establishing', 'conformance', 'protocols', 'usaf', 'dependent', 'variable', 'data', 'regarding', 'training', 'collected', 'sampling', 'civilian', 'usaf', 'employees', 'comparisons', 'user', 'conformity', 'levels', 'procedures', 'required', 'training', 'users', 'perceptions', 'time', 'spent', 'training', 'conformity', 'protocols', 'demonstrated', 'increased', 'training', 'time', 'equated', 'overall', 'perceived', 'greater', 'understanding', 'roles', 'conformance', 'security', 'protocols', 'results', 'potential', 'contribute', 'positive', 'social', 'change', 'helping', 'understand', 'impact', 'training', 'dynamics', 'user', 'compliance', 'protocols', 'usaf', 'cyber', 'network', 'thus', 'utilizing', 'results', 'usaf', 'could', 'insure', 'higher', 'level', 'user', 'conformity', 'security', 'protocols']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Continuous Learning
Exploring the impact of the Clinger-Cohen Act on information technology governance: A phenomenological study,"Passage of the Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA) of 1996 was in direct response to Congressional inquiry into the perceived lack of proper management and oversight of information technology (IT) in the federal agencies. This current qualitative phenomenological study explored the lived experiences and perceptions of 20 IT professionals to determine if the CCA had influenced IT governance processes in the United States Department of Defense (DoD). An interview guide was used to guide the discussions and collect the data. Seven core themes emerged from the research. According to the data, 90% of the study participants opined that the CCA remains relevant today. This conclusion was significant because it emphasized the continual importance of the legislation in influencing IT management and oversight. The study findings also revealed that the CCA has impacted IT governance processes in the DoD, which formulated the premise for the current research. IT governance processes provides decision-makers with the tools necessary to evaluate whether investments in major IT initiatives will yield the expected returns for the organization.",193925391,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Gillam, Mary M.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2010," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Clinger-Cohen Act , Department of Defense , Federal agencies , Governance , Government accountability , IT governance , IT investments , Information technology , United States Department of Defense", 978-1-109-71599-6,,, English, English,,,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploring-impact-clinger-cohen-act-on-information/docview/193925391/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploring+the+impact+of+the+Clinger-Cohen+Act+on+information+technology+governance%3A+A+phenomenological+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gillam%2C+Mary+M.&amp;isbn=978-1-109-71599-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,passage act cca direct response congressional inquiry perceived lack proper management oversight information technology federal agency current qualitative phenomenological explored lived experience perception professional determine cca influenced governance process united state interview guide used guide discussion collect seven core theme emerged according participant opined cca remains relevant today conclusion significant emphasized continual importance legislation influencing management oversight finding also revealed cca impacted governance process formulated premise current governance process provides tool necessary evaluate whether investment major initiative yield expected return organization,"['passage', 'act', 'cca', 'direct', 'response', 'congressional', 'inquiry', 'perceived', 'lack', 'proper', 'management', 'oversight', 'information', 'technology', 'federal', 'agencies', 'current', 'qualitative', 'phenomenological', 'explored', 'lived', 'experiences', 'perceptions', 'professionals', 'determine', 'cca', 'influenced', 'governance', 'processes', 'united', 'states', 'interview', 'guide', 'used', 'guide', 'discussions', 'collect', 'data', 'seven', 'core', 'themes', 'emerged', 'according', 'data', 'participants', 'opined', 'cca', 'remains', 'relevant', 'today', 'conclusion', 'significant', 'emphasized', 'continual', 'importance', 'legislation', 'influencing', 'management', 'oversight', 'findings', 'also', 'revealed', 'cca', 'impacted', 'governance', 'processes', 'formulated', 'premise', 'current', 'governance', 'processes', 'provides', 'tools', 'necessary', 'evaluate', 'whether', 'investments', 'major', 'initiatives', 'yield', 'expected', 'returns', 'organization']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
DoD COMPTROLLER WORKFORCE of the FUTURE,"In the Defense Department, different skill sets will be required of comptrollers in order to support senior decision makers as well as to implement and use new enterprise-wide commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software packages. The services and many DoD agencies currently are developing and fielding Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to transform their business processes. Operational experience at various levels - such as different commands, across the services, or even in other federal agencies - will be needed in order to understand the complexity of the COTS business solutions. The future workforce must be more IT savvy. Both budget analysts and accountants will require more crossover training into the other's professional skills. Comptrollers should take training to develop any skill set that they lack. Seek rotational assignments to obtain the proper skills and volunteer for difficult assignments. The key to a clean audit opinion is the command's internal control program. Each command/service should obtain an automated tool that will facilitate easy update of the process. As comptroller professionals, we need to determine which data are required in order to do our jobs, what internal controls are necessary at each step in the process, and how revised processes affect the current management control program and at what point.",194775528,,,Trade Journals,,"Meadows, Linda J", AFCMAF, Department of Defense, Copyright American Society of Military Comptrollers Fall 2009,,, Feature,, Fall 2009," Workforce , COTS",,0004-2188,4.0, English, English,, 19-22, Alexandria,Fall 2009,The Armed Forces Comptroller,2009,,54.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/dod-comptroller-workforce-future/docview/194775528/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aaccounting&amp;atitle=DoD+COMPTROLLER+WORKFORCE+of+the+FUTURE&amp;title=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;issn=00042188&amp;date=2009-10-01&amp;volume=54&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=19&amp;au=Meadows%2C+Linda+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",different skill set required comptroller order support senior decision maker well implement use new commercial cot software package service many agency currently developing fielding enterprise resource planning erp system transform business process operational experience various level different command across service even federal agency needed order understand complexity cot business solution future workforce must savvy budget analyst accountant require crossover training professional skill comptroller take training develop skill set lack seek rotational assignment obtain proper skill volunteer difficult assignment key clean audit opinion command internal control program obtain automated tool facilitate easy update process comptroller professional need determine required order job internal control necessary step process revised process affect current management control program point,"['different', 'skill', 'sets', 'required', 'comptrollers', 'order', 'support', 'senior', 'decision', 'makers', 'well', 'implement', 'use', 'new', 'commercial', 'cots', 'software', 'packages', 'services', 'many', 'agencies', 'currently', 'developing', 'fielding', 'enterprise', 'resource', 'planning', 'erp', 'systems', 'transform', 'business', 'processes', 'operational', 'experience', 'various', 'levels', 'different', 'commands', 'across', 'services', 'even', 'federal', 'agencies', 'needed', 'order', 'understand', 'complexity', 'cots', 'business', 'solutions', 'future', 'workforce', 'must', 'savvy', 'budget', 'analysts', 'accountants', 'require', 'crossover', 'training', 'professional', 'skills', 'comptrollers', 'take', 'training', 'develop', 'skill', 'set', 'lack', 'seek', 'rotational', 'assignments', 'obtain', 'proper', 'skills', 'volunteer', 'difficult', 'assignments', 'key', 'clean', 'audit', 'opinion', 'command', 'internal', 'control', 'program', 'obtain', 'automated', 'tool', 'facilitate', 'easy', 'update', 'process', 'comptroller', 'professionals', 'need', 'determine', 'data', 'required', 'order', 'jobs', 'internal', 'controls', 'necessary', 'step', 'process', 'revised', 'processes', 'affect', 'current', 'management', 'control', 'program', 'point']",Feature,0,Management and Leadership
Defense Watch,"C-17 Call. Eighteen senators request funding for a dozen more Boeing C-17 cargo haulers, which are not in the Pentagon's budget proposal, in an Aug. 20 letter to Senate Appropriations Committee (SAC) Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) and Ranking Member Thad Cochran (R-Miss.). The duo will unveil their panel's fiscal year 2010 defense appropriations bill after the August recess. ""First and foremost, the C-17 has been critical in transporting troops and equipment to and from Iraq and Afghanistan and we do not see airlift needs abating anytime soon,"" the 18 senators write. The C-17 backers say it is ""premature"" to shut down the C-17 line in 2010 before the release of coming air-mobility reports, and add they are concerned about the aerospace industry atrophying. Reefer Sadness. The Navy will transfer the decommissioned destroyer ex-Arthur W. Radford to the state of Delaware for use as an artificial reef. The ship was made available to all Gulf and Atlantic states in May 2008 using the Navy's reefing program application process, and the Navy received only the application from the tri-state group, the Navy says. ""Although several other alternatives are also used to reduce the Navy's inventory of inactive ships, artificial reefing has many benefits,"" says Glen Clark, deputy program manager of the Navy Inactive Ships Program. The ex-Arthur W. Radford will ultimately be reefed at the jointly-developed Del-Jersey-Land Inshore Site, which is equidistant from Cape May, N.J., Ocean City, Md., and Indian River Inlet, Del. The site was permitted in 2006 and has an area of about one square mile and a depth of 120-130 feet. In the coming weeks, Naval Sea Systems Command will coordinate and negotiate the details of a complete transfer agreement, including the timeline for reefing, before officially removing the ship from Navy custody, the Navy adds. Earning Trust. The Pentagon's Defense Microelectronics Activity accredits BAE Systems' microelectronics foundry in Nashua as a trusted supplier of microelectronics for DoD and other government customers. This is the second BAE semiconductor facility to achieve trusted status. The company's Semiconductor Technology Center in Manassas, Va., which develops and produces radiation-hardened and other silicon-based technologies, was accredited as a trusted source in December 2006. ""Achieving trusted supplier status recognizes the Microelectronics Center's continuing role as a provider of critical semiconductor components for the DoD,"" Scott Powell, director of the New Hampshire facility, says in a statement. The foundry's capabilities include monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) and other devices based on two compound semiconductor materials--gallium arsenide and gallium nitride.",234071877,,,Trade Journals,,Anonymous,," Boeing Co , Northrop Grumman Corp"," (Copyright (c) 2009 Access Intelligence, LLC.

Countervailing Pressures and Process Challenges,"Part of establishing a sound fiscal policy is to set clear priorities for what the federal government will and will not do, in what proportions, and determine how best to pay for them. Addressing the US' fiscal imbalance must necessarily look at outlays and one of the largest categories of federal spending is national defense. Some factors external to the Department of Defense (DoD) put downward pressure on the defense budget. The budget deficit pressurizes the entire budget, and, some believe, encourages limitations on overall spending. The White House and Congress will need to accept the loss of the short-term benefits of supplemental appropriations, such as accelerating the authorization and appropriations process and masking the full extent of budget deficits and the cost of war. President Barack Obama has only a short time to begin to change the defense budget.",222383468,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Brook, Douglas A, PhD;Candreva, Philip J, MS",, Department of Defense, Copyright Association of Government Accountants Spring 2009,,, Feature,, Spring 2009," Fiscal policy , Defense",,1533-1385,1.0, English, English,, 10-15, Alexandria,Spring 2009,The Journal of Government Financial Management,2009,,58.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/whither-defense-budget-countervailing-pressures/docview/222383468/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Whither+the+Defense+Budget%3F+Countervailing+Pressures+and+Process+Challenges&amp;title=The+Journal+of+Government+Financial+Management&amp;issn=15331385&amp;date=2009-04-01&amp;volume=58&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=10&amp;au=Brook%2C+Douglas+A%2C+PhD%3BCandreva%2C+Philip+J%2C+MS&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Journal+of+Government+Financial+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,part establishing sound fiscal policy set clear priority federal government proportion determine best pay addressing fiscal imbalance must necessarily look outlay one largest category federal spending national factor external put downward pressure budget budget deficit pressurizes entire budget believe encourages limitation overall spending white house congress need accept loss benefit supplemental appropriation accelerating authorization appropriation process masking full extent budget deficit cost war president barack obama short time begin change budget,"['part', 'establishing', 'sound', 'fiscal', 'policy', 'set', 'clear', 'priorities', 'federal', 'government', 'proportions', 'determine', 'best', 'pay', 'addressing', 'fiscal', 'imbalance', 'must', 'necessarily', 'look', 'outlays', 'one', 'largest', 'categories', 'federal', 'spending', 'national', 'factors', 'external', 'put', 'downward', 'pressure', 'budget', 'budget', 'deficit', 'pressurizes', 'entire', 'budget', 'believe', 'encourages', 'limitations', 'overall', 'spending', 'white', 'house', 'congress', 'need', 'accept', 'loss', 'benefits', 'supplemental', 'appropriations', 'accelerating', 'authorization', 'appropriations', 'process', 'masking', 'full', 'extent', 'budget', 'deficits', 'cost', 'war', 'president', 'barack', 'obama', 'short', 'time', 'begin', 'change', 'budget']",Feature,2,Management and Leadership
The Chief Financial Officer Academy: Meeting Strategic Training Needs,"The need to develop strategic leaders in federal financial management has been a growing concern since passage of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act of 1990. The future economic climate has given increased urgency to this need. The recent Association of Government Accountants study titled, 21st Century Federal Financial Managers, identified the leadership needs of federal financial managers in the coming years. The study indicated that federal agencies have been slow to train and acquire employees who are proficient in an environment where work is being shaped by new technology, such as integrated financial systems. In 2008, the Department of Defense volunteered to create the CFO Academy at the National Defense University at Washington DC's Fort McNair. In the words of its mission statement, the CFO Academy exists to prepare middle- to senior-level members of the government financial management community for senior 21st century management and leadership responsibilities.",222383008,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Aguilera, Ricardo;Holmberg, John;Gregory, Sandra",, National Defense University, Copyright Association of Government Accountants Spring 2009,,, Feature,, Spring 2009," Strategic leadership , Financial management , Leadership , Training",,1533-1385,1.0, English, English,, 26-29, Alexandria,Spring 2009,The Journal of Government Financial Management,2009,,58.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/chief-financial-officer-academy-meeting-strategic/docview/222383008/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=The+Chief+Financial+Officer+Academy%3A+Meeting+Strategic+Training+Needs&amp;title=The+Journal+of+Government+Financial+Management&amp;issn=15331385&amp;date=2009-04-01&amp;volume=58&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=26&amp;au=Aguilera%2C+Ricardo%3BHolmberg%2C+John%3BGregory%2C+Sandra&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Journal+of+Government+Financial+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,need develop strategic leader federal financial management growing concern since passage chief financial officer cfo act future economic climate given increased urgency need recent association government accountant titled century federal financial manager identified leadership need federal financial manager coming year indicated federal agency slow train acquire employee proficient environment work shaped new technology integrated financial system volunteered create cfo academy national washington fort mcnair word mission statement cfo academy exists prepare member government financial management community senior century management leadership responsibility,"['need', 'develop', 'strategic', 'leaders', 'federal', 'financial', 'management', 'growing', 'concern', 'since', 'passage', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'cfo', 'act', 'future', 'economic', 'climate', 'given', 'increased', 'urgency', 'need', 'recent', 'association', 'government', 'accountants', 'titled', 'century', 'federal', 'financial', 'managers', 'identified', 'leadership', 'needs', 'federal', 'financial', 'managers', 'coming', 'years', 'indicated', 'federal', 'agencies', 'slow', 'train', 'acquire', 'employees', 'proficient', 'environment', 'work', 'shaped', 'new', 'technology', 'integrated', 'financial', 'systems', 'volunteered', 'create', 'cfo', 'academy', 'national', 'university', 'washington', 'fort', 'mcnair', 'words', 'mission', 'statement', 'cfo', 'academy', 'exists', 'prepare', 'members', 'government', 'financial', 'management', 'community', 'senior', 'century', 'management', 'leadership', 'responsibilities']",Feature,2,Management and Leadership
"WEST COAST BASING OF THE MV-22, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN ARIZONA. [Part 12 of 12]","PURPOSE: The basing of up to ten squadrons (120 aircraft) of the MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor (MV-22) aircraft on the West Coast and construction and/or renovation of necessary airfield facilities are proposed. The proposed introduction of MV-22 aircraft to the West Coast is part of a U.S. Marine Corps (USMC)-wide process of replacing its aging fleet of medium lift helicopters with more advanced aircraft and would involve conducting MV-22 training operations and special exercise operations including firing the aircraft's machine gun at existing targets. The proposed action would replace nine helicopter squadrons (114 aircraft) currently authorized for basing on the West Coast. In addition to a No Action Alternative, the following basing alternatives are addressed in this final EIS: 1) full basing of 10 squadrons at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Miramar, 2) partial (split) basing at MCAS Miramar and at MCAS Camp Pendleton, 3) partial basing MCAS Yuma and at MCAS Camp Pendleton, and 4) partial basing at MCAS Miramar and MCAS Yuma. Under all basing alternatives, MV-22 training and readiness operations would be conducted at Marine Corps Base (MCB) Camp Pendleton, the Bob Stump Training Range Complex (Chocolate Mountain Aerial Bombing and Gunnery Range, Barry M. Goldwater Range), Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, and on various Military Training Routes (MTRs). The preferred alternative is eight squadrons at MCAS Miramar and two squadrons at MCAS Camp Pendleton, both in San Diego County, California. This basing option would best meet the fundamental selection criteria of distance, capacity, and compatibility while minimizing adverse effects on biological resources; and would best meet five preferential criteria of proximity to the Ground Combat Elements of the Marine Expeditionary Force, presence of a Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron, proximity to appropriate training areas and Special Use Airspace, available capacity to accommodate the aircraft and personnel, and manpower and military construction costs. The preferred alternative would lead to an increase of 48 aircraft and 746 military personnel at MCAS Miramar and a reduction of 18 aircraft and 257 military personnel at MCAS Camp Pendleton. POSITIVE IMPACTS: The replacement of less-capable, 1960s-era CH-46E helicopters with MV-22 aircraft would modernize the USMC medium lift fleet and improve the operational capabilities of the Third and Fourth Marine Aircraft Wing squadrons. NEGATIVE IMPACTS: The preferred alternative would result in significant and unmitigated impacts to land use and ground traffic and transportation. Significant but mitigable impacts to topography, geology, and soils would occur and biological and cultural resources would be impacted. Approximately 46,000 total MV-22 annual operations are expected to occur at the training ranges and MTRs under consideration and would result in a net increase in such operations of 18,900.

Re-Engineering USAF Avionics Maintenance: Lean Challenges,"  The Versatile Depot Automatic Test System, or VDATS, the Air Force's new standard tester, breaks with the service's tradition of platform-specific automatic test equipment (ATE). Based on industry-standard interfaces and commercial instruments, the new system promises to make USAF avionics maintenance a more efficient affair. The service's ""first true family of testers,"" VDATS has been approved by the Department of Defense (DoD) Automatic Test System Management Board as a test solution that could be adopted department-wide, says Col. Dave French, commander of the 742nd Combat Sustainment Group at Warner Robins ALC. USAF programs are writing VDATS into their requirements, he said, including upgrades to the F-15 and F-16, the unmanned air vehicles community and electronic warfare systems. VDATS consists of three bays - a two-bay, ""common core"" of analog and digital instruments and an optional, third, ""roll-up"" bay for radio frequency (RF) diagnostics. Although its range is far greater than the depot's current ATE equipment, VDATS is much smaller than many legacy testers, which can average six to seven bays, alone, French said. Another big plus is that it's designed with built-in calibration capability. VDATS includes a PATEC (Portable Automated Test Equipment Calibrator) system that rolls up to the ATE and calibrates its instruments without having to remove them. A complete VDATS system can be calibrated in four to six hours, Air Force officials said. VDATS will be a boon for the Robins depot. Many of the ALC's more than 200 testers are 26 or more years old and are already ""hanging on by a thread"" in terms of their technology obsolescence, [Ken Percell] says. Fifty percent uptime is good for some of the more venerable equipment, officials say. They hope for 90 percent availability with the new system. Most of the testers in the avionics shops are one-of-a-kind, says Jimmy Beeland, squadron director for VDATS. So when the tester breaks down or is idled for calibration, work on avionics systems that is done on that tester ""basically stops."" If the shops were organized to maximize the number of cards a VDATS unit could test, he said, digital cards from many systems could be tested across the same ATE.",228335052,,,Trade Journals,,Anonymous,, Air Force-US," (Copyright (c) 2009 Access Intelligence, LLC.

Naval Approach to Decision Making,"A World War II general once said that a good battle plan implemented promptly was much better perfect battle plan implemented too late. Effective and efficient decision making follows a similar logic. The decision maker must choose between competing alternatives, using data with varying degrees of uncertainty while frequently facing time pressures. In 2003, the Navy established all Echelon II command called Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC). CNIC is the Navy's command, technical authority and single process owner for shore installation management. CNIC's mission is to enable and sustain fleet, fighter and family readiness through consistent, standardized and reliable shore support. The Navy's programmatic application of risk-based strategies represents a new stage in continuous improvement for resource allocation planning in the Department of Defense (DoD).",213852204,,,Trade Journals,,"Edmonds, Yolanda;Rooney, James J",,, Copyright American Society for Quality Feb 2009,,, Feature,, Feb 2009," Decision-making , Navy , Resource allocation , Decision",,1539-4069,2.0, English, English,, 34-35, Milwaukee,Feb 2009,ASQ Six Sigma Forum Magazine,2009,,8.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/naval-approach-decision-making/docview/213852204/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Naval+Approach+to+Decision+Making&amp;title=ASQ+Six+Sigma+Forum+Magazine&amp;issn=15394069&amp;date=2009-02-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=34&amp;au=Edmonds%2C+Yolanda%3BRooney%2C+James+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=ASQ+Six+Sigma+Forum+Magazine&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,world war general said good battle plan implemented promptly much better perfect battle plan implemented late effective efficient decision making follows similar logic decision maker must choose competing alternative using varying degree uncertainty frequently facing time pressure navy established echelon command called commander navy installation command cnic cnic navy command technical authority single process owner shore installation management cnic mission enable sustain fleet fighter family readiness consistent standardized reliable shore support navy programmatic application strategy represents new stage continuous improvement resource allocation planning,"['world', 'war', 'general', 'said', 'good', 'battle', 'plan', 'implemented', 'promptly', 'much', 'better', 'perfect', 'battle', 'plan', 'implemented', 'late', 'effective', 'efficient', 'decision', 'making', 'follows', 'similar', 'logic', 'decision', 'maker', 'must', 'choose', 'competing', 'alternatives', 'using', 'data', 'varying', 'degrees', 'uncertainty', 'frequently', 'facing', 'time', 'pressures', 'navy', 'established', 'echelon', 'command', 'called', 'commander', 'navy', 'installations', 'command', 'cnic', 'cnic', 'navy', 'command', 'technical', 'authority', 'single', 'process', 'owner', 'shore', 'installation', 'management', 'cnic', 'mission', 'enable', 'sustain', 'fleet', 'fighter', 'family', 'readiness', 'consistent', 'standardized', 'reliable', 'shore', 'support', 'navy', 'programmatic', 'application', 'strategies', 'represents', 'new', 'stage', 'continuous', 'improvement', 'resource', 'allocation', 'planning']",Feature,2,Management and Leadership

Ensuring the Best Defense,"Continuous improvement (CI) is not a new focus for the US Department of Defense (DoD). In the early 1990s, the DoD began to look for more effective and efficient methods to perform its mission. The Air Force, Defense Contract Management Command (DCMC) and Army led the effort, establishing quality awards based on the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence. The DoD's mission requires that its business operations effectively and efficiently support its warfighters and adapt to meet all challenges, such as increased financial constraints, changing regulations and policy, the threat of terrorists, and strategic and tactical course shifts. With the enterprise transition plan and governance in place, the DoD identified the means by which results would be achieved.

DoD acquisition workforce education: An SBA education case study,"A Department of Defense (DoD) M&amp;S education task force is in the process of studying the Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) education of the acquisition workforce. Historically, DoD acquisition workforce education is not referred to as education, but rather what the Defense Acquisition University (DAU) refers to as “practitioner training, career management, and services.” The DAU is the organization primarily responsible for training the DoD acquisition corps in conjunction with service schools and strategic partners in the civilian sector. DAU programs primarily focus on program management, contracting, and management of logistics across the system life cycle. Further, the examples and cases used in the training are primarily DoD centric. Only select DoD employees are exposed to Harvard Business School (HBS) perspectives. The use of M&amp;S to improve system acquisition is only delivered in three courses. Further, Simulation-Based Acquisition (SBA) as a strategy in development of various systems is not explicitly taught. The general notion for this research is that exposure of actual or potential defense acquisition students to the rich civilian literature on M&amp;S across the enterprise life cycle and SBA in particular may be beneficial to DoD. To further this general notion, this research investigates content in courses whose curriculum, while still more than 50% DoD, contains HBS SBA and other M&amp;S related case studies. While abbreviated for the purpose of this abstract, the overall hypothesis of this dissertation is that M&amp;S and HBS case studies make a positive contribution to DoD or potential DoD employees. To investigate this hypothesis, this research conducted both internal and external evaluations to determine the level to which the course makes a positive contribution to the student ability to “Understand the concepts of SBA across the entire program life cycle, in order to reduce the time, resources, and risks associated with the acquisition process”. This was identified by the task force as a key element in the Education Skills Requirement (ESR) that this curriculum intends to address. The internal evaluation used inferential statistics to consider the validity of the course topics, content, evaluation methods, and case study delivery method through student evaluations of a live class. Among other variables, this research tracks class participants’ responses (self-assessment) and performance (subject matter expert objective assessment) demographically to include current and potential DoD employees. With the graying of DoD workforce, potential DoD employees are important to the DoD community too. The external evaluation likewise considers the validity of the course topics and content through a survey of acquisition professionals external to the class. External acquisition professionals are drawn from across DoD as well as include former DoD acquisition employees. The combination of the internal and external evaluations provides insight into these and other issues related to the course topics, content, evaluation methods, and case study delivery methods and make recommendations on these and other issues for future course offerings.",603753643,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Davenport, Richard W.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim

Assessing workers' true and perceived sense of urgency during strategic change: A descriptive and correlational examination,"Many change programs fail because those executing the change initiatives lack adequate urgency to make change happen. Of all the causes for failed change efforts, a low sense of urgency (SOU) is the most prevalent. The problem addressed in this study is that U.S. Air Force leaders have initiated a strategic change program without assessing whether adequate urgency exists to successfully implement and sustain the program. This quantitative study was designed to assess urgency levels that exist within an Air Force Security Assistance community. Assessed were workers' perceived sense of urgency (PSOU), their true sense of urgency (TSOU), and their awareness of the vision for change (VA). Using data collected via an online survey, descriptive statistics for n = 57 revealed that 49% of workers were identified as having a PSOU, none measured to have a TSOU, and 23% were aware of the program's vision. The data also revealed a difference of 9.19 between the TSOU and PSOU means. A correlational analysis showed a positive relationship between PSOU and VA and a negative relationship between TSOU and VA. A key conclusion was white workers perceived they provide sufficient urgency to support the change initiatives, their PSOU did not equal that of true or measured urgency. This study concluded with practical recommendations for increasing PSOU, TSOU, and VA as well as recommendations for future research to further understand these variables and narrow the gap in literature regarding understanding PSOU and TSOU.",305178734,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Johnson, James E.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2009," Social sciences , Change , Change management , Managing change , Organizational change , Sense of urgency , Urgency", 978-1-109-22165-7,,, English, English,,,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/assessing-workers-true-perceived-sense-urgency/docview/305178734/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Assessing+workers%27+true+and+perceived+sense+of+urgency+during+strategic+change%3A+A+descriptive+and+correlational+examination&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+James+E.&amp;isbn=978-1-109-22165-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,many change program fail executing change initiative lack adequate urgency make change happen cause failed change effort low sense urgency sou prevalent problem addressed air force leader initiated strategic change program without assessing whether adequate urgency exists successfully implement sustain program quantitative designed assess urgency level exist within air force security assistance community assessed worker perceived sense urgency psou true sense urgency tsou awareness vision change using collected via online survey descriptive statistic revealed worker identified psou none measured tsou aware program vision also revealed difference tsou psou mean correlational showed positive relationship psou negative relationship tsou key conclusion white worker perceived provide sufficient urgency support change initiative psou equal true measured urgency concluded practical recommendation increasing psou tsou well recommendation future understand variable narrow gap literature regarding understanding psou tsou,"['many', 'change', 'programs', 'fail', 'executing', 'change', 'initiatives', 'lack', 'adequate', 'urgency', 'make', 'change', 'happen', 'causes', 'failed', 'change', 'efforts', 'low', 'sense', 'urgency', 'sou', 'prevalent', 'problem', 'addressed', 'air', 'force', 'leaders', 'initiated', 'strategic', 'change', 'program', 'without', 'assessing', 'whether', 'adequate', 'urgency', 'exists', 'successfully', 'implement', 'sustain', 'program', 'quantitative', 'designed', 'assess', 'urgency', 'levels', 'exist', 'within', 'air', 'force', 'security', 'assistance', 'community', 'assessed', 'workers', 'perceived', 'sense', 'urgency', 'psou', 'true', 'sense', 'urgency', 'tsou', 'awareness', 'vision', 'change', 'using', 'data', 'collected', 'via', 'online', 'survey', 'descriptive', 'statistics', 'revealed', 'workers', 'identified', 'psou', 'none', 'measured', 'tsou', 'aware', 'program', 'vision', 'data', 'also', 'revealed', 'difference', 'tsou', 'psou', 'means', 'correlational', 'showed', 'positive', 'relationship', 'psou', 'negative', 'relationship', 'tsou', 'key', 'conclusion', 'white', 'workers', 'perceived', 'provide', 'sufficient', 'urgency', 'support', 'change', 'initiatives', 'psou', 'equal', 'true', 'measured', 'urgency', 'concluded', 'practical', 'recommendations', 'increasing', 'psou', 'tsou', 'well', 'recommendations', 'future', 'understand', 'variables', 'narrow', 'gap', 'literature', 'regarding', 'understanding', 'psou', 'tsou']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Exploring the requirements for full-time manning within the Army National Guard,"Strategic human capital management is a persistent challenge that many leaders of organizations face. Deploying the right skill sets, in the right places, at the right time is a delicate balance that all Human Resource (HR) managers should strive to achieve. Effective workforce planning is an essential tool to forecast suitable workload staffing levels, and justify budget allocations, so that the organizational leadership can achieve their stated long-term goals and objectives (Keel, 2006). Like many other organizations, the operating environment of the Army National Guard (ARNG) has been impacted by changes in national security, technology, budgets, demographics, and other factors. However, the full-time manning model has not transformed along with the ARNG's new organizational situations and missions. This may have resulted in a full-time labor force that is insufficient to accomplish the work required (Blum, 2007). The following qualitative dissertation study was designed to gain attitudinal insight, from a purposefully selected population, regarding the suitability and supportability of the current ARNG full-time manning model to meet the current and long-term strategic needs of the organization. A content examination of the attitudes reflected that significant weaknesses exist in the current ARNG manpower model. Key findings suggested a considerable gap in the published guidance and formulas used by the present model to compute ARNG manpower authorizations. A strongly perceived shortcoming was also observed regarding the correct mix and number of personnel. Furthermore, the study found that a majority of participants believed that alternative critical mission factors and key characteristics should be taken into consideration when computing FTS/FTM authorizations. A rank order of these factors and characteristics is provided in the study's findings. Research recommendations include improving the personnel resource administrator's general knowledge about the current manpower models, updating the present FTS manning guidelines, and continuing to work with lobbyists to seek a more abbreviated ramp-up of authorization percentages and gain congressional approval to base the ramp-up on more near-term requirements. A more complex and long-term recommendation was that the leadership of the National Guard Bureau and the Department of the Army reconsider the attributes of the present ARNG FTS manpower models.",305176606,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Blaes, Jeanne Joachim",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,,

The formation of Collaborative Inter- Organizational Networks,"Collaborative Inter-Organizational Networks (CIONs) are part of a new trend to increase a community's—the combined organizations'—capacity to solve complex problems. This dissertation seeks to comprehend why initiatives to form public-sector led CIONs often fail to meet expectations. The methodology employed in the research is an organizational ethnography of a DoD/VA–led CION as well as expert interviews of individuals participating in the formation of other government-led CIONs. Findings confirm Wenger's participation-reification duality and suggest that a tension between these forces can undermine the formation of CIONs.

The impact upon key performance measures in applying lean enterprise initiatives by defense contractors,"According to Murman, Allen, Bozdogan, Cutcher-Gershenfeld, McManus, Nightingale, et al., Lean enterprise value: Insights from MIT's lean aerospace initiative, (2002), Lean enterprise initiatives (LEIs) have been applied to commercial large volume manufacturing processes with minimal variation, such as those found in the automobile and aerospace industries, with continued success. This study showed that there was some correlation achieved by applying LEIs such as: (a) value stream analysis, (b) supply chain management, (c) total quality management, (d) Six Sigma, (e) ISO certifications, (f) continuous improvements, and (g) process reduction initiatives to low volume-manufacturing processes with multiple variations typically found in the defense industry. The study also determined the impact of applying these LEIs by defense contractors and investigating the changes they have on key performance measures (KPMs) such as: (a) financial, (b) manufacturing methods, (c) quality management, and (d) environmental management. It also determined differences in the viewpoints of senior leadership and middle management in the areas of (a) quality management systems, (b) lean manufacturing, and (c) environmental management. The results from this research, in the defense industry, were compared to findings from a previous automobile study to determine if a statistically significant difference existed between the two industries. These research findings could provide information useful to the senior leadership of defense contractors, the Department of Defense (DoD), and other organizations by discovering if a correlation to KPMs exists when LEIs are implemented by defense contractors.",305128764,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Humbert, Elmer Rhodie",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2009," Social sciences , Aerospace , Company performance , Defense companies , Defense contractors , Defense industry , Lean enterprise , Performance measures", 978-1-109-45557-1,,, English, English,,,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/impact-upon-key-performance-measures-applying/docview/305128764/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+impact+upon+key+performance+measures+in+applying+lean+enterprise+initiatives+by+defense+contractors&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Humbert%2C+Elmer+Rhodie&amp;isbn=978-1-109-45557-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",according murman allen bozdogan mcmanus nightingale lean enterprise value insight mit lean aerospace initiative lean enterprise initiative lei applied commercial large volume manufacturing process minimal variation found automobile aerospace industry continued success showed correlation achieved applying lei value stream supply chain management total quality management six sigma iso certification continuous improvement process reduction initiative low process multiple variation typically found industry also determined impact applying lei contractor investigating change key performance measure kpms financial manufacturing method quality management environmental management also determined difference viewpoint senior leadership middle management area quality management system lean manufacturing environmental management result industry compared finding previous automobile determine statistically significant difference existed two industry finding could provide information useful senior leadership contractor organization discovering correlation kpms exists lei implemented contractor,"['according', 'murman', 'allen', 'bozdogan', 'mcmanus', 'nightingale', 'lean', 'enterprise', 'value', 'insights', 'mit', 'lean', 'aerospace', 'initiative', 'lean', 'enterprise', 'initiatives', 'leis', 'applied', 'commercial', 'large', 'volume', 'manufacturing', 'processes', 'minimal', 'variation', 'found', 'automobile', 'aerospace', 'industries', 'continued', 'success', 'showed', 'correlation', 'achieved', 'applying', 'leis', 'value', 'stream', 'supply', 'chain', 'management', 'total', 'quality', 'management', 'six', 'sigma', 'iso', 'certifications', 'continuous', 'improvements', 'process', 'reduction', 'initiatives', 'low', 'processes', 'multiple', 'variations', 'typically', 'found', 'industry', 'also', 'determined', 'impact', 'applying', 'leis', 'contractors', 'investigating', 'changes', 'key', 'performance', 'measures', 'kpms', 'financial', 'manufacturing', 'methods', 'quality', 'management', 'environmental', 'management', 'also', 'determined', 'differences', 'viewpoints', 'senior', 'leadership', 'middle', 'management', 'areas', 'quality', 'management', 'systems', 'lean', 'manufacturing', 'environmental', 'management', 'results', 'industry', 'compared', 'findings', 'previous', 'automobile', 'determine', 'statistically', 'significant', 'difference', 'existed', 'two', 'industries', 'findings', 'could', 'provide', 'information', 'useful', 'senior', 'leadership', 'contractors', 'organizations', 'discovering', 'correlation', 'kpms', 'exists', 'leis', 'implemented', 'contractors']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement
A case study of collaborative communications within the U.S. Army Medical Department logistics community,"Health care begins with effective logistical support and when managed effectively, contributes to an enhanced capability that spans a broad spectrum of health care support. The purpose of this mixed method, practice-oriented case study was to explore definitions and understanding of collaborative communication strategies in the management of a health care supply chain. The population studied included a purposive sample of 214 (41%) out of 528 U.S. Army health care logisticians who participated in a survey to develop a common operational definition of collaborative communications in supply chain management. Five themes related to the study included synergy, teamwork, enhancements in supply chain management, the need to continue training throughout a career, and commonalities in views among junior and senior executives as elements of collaborative health care supply chain management practices. The conclusions extrapolated from the study suggested that impressions of collaborative supply chain management practices and processes do not change as one matures in a career. Collaborative supply chain management involves a synergistic work environment wherein multiple parties work together toward the enhancement of supply chain practices and processes. Through the conduct of the study, no relationship could be established between improved supply chain management practices and effective collaborative communication strategies (χ 2 ν = 3.995, p = .046). Likewise, no relationship could be established regarding shared understanding between senior and junior levels of leadership regarding effective collaborative communication and effective supply chain management (χ 2 ν = 5.53, p = .0187).",305128164,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"VanVactor, Jerry D.",, Army-US, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2009," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Collaborative communications , Health care , Logistics , Management , Medical Department , United States Army", 978-1-109-52696-7,,, English, English,,,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/case-study-collaborative-communications-within-u/docview/305128164/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+case+study+of+collaborative+communications+within+the+U.S.+Army+Medical+Department+logistics+community&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=VanVactor%2C+Jerry+D.&amp;isbn=978-1-109-52696-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Health Research Premium Collection, Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",health care begin effective logistical support managed effectively contributes enhanced capability span broad spectrum health care support purpose mixed case explore definition understanding collaborative communication strategy management health care supply chain population studied included purposive sample army health care logistician participated survey develop common operational definition collaborative communication supply chain management five theme related included synergy teamwork enhancement supply chain management need continue training throughout career commonality view among junior senior executive element collaborative health care supply chain management practice conclusion extrapolated suggested impression collaborative supply chain management practice process change one matures career collaborative supply chain management involves synergistic work environment wherein multiple party work together toward enhancement supply chain practice process conduct relationship could established improved supply chain management practice effective collaborative communication strategy likewise relationship could established regarding shared understanding senior junior level leadership regarding effective collaborative communication effective supply chain management,"['health', 'care', 'begins', 'effective', 'logistical', 'support', 'managed', 'effectively', 'contributes', 'enhanced', 'capability', 'spans', 'broad', 'spectrum', 'health', 'care', 'support', 'purpose', 'mixed', 'case', 'explore', 'definitions', 'understanding', 'collaborative', 'communication', 'strategies', 'management', 'health', 'care', 'supply', 'chain', 'population', 'studied', 'included', 'purposive', 'sample', 'army', 'health', 'care', 'logisticians', 'participated', 'survey', 'develop', 'common', 'operational', 'definition', 'collaborative', 'communications', 'supply', 'chain', 'management', 'five', 'themes', 'related', 'included', 'synergy', 'teamwork', 'enhancements', 'supply', 'chain', 'management', 'need', 'continue', 'training', 'throughout', 'career', 'commonalities', 'views', 'among', 'junior', 'senior', 'executives', 'elements', 'collaborative', 'health', 'care', 'supply', 'chain', 'management', 'practices', 'conclusions', 'extrapolated', 'suggested', 'impressions', 'collaborative', 'supply', 'chain', 'management', 'practices', 'processes', 'change', 'one', 'matures', 'career', 'collaborative', 'supply', 'chain', 'management', 'involves', 'synergistic', 'work', 'environment', 'wherein', 'multiple', 'parties', 'work', 'together', 'toward', 'enhancement', 'supply', 'chain', 'practices', 'processes', 'conduct', 'relationship', 'could', 'established', 'improved', 'supply', 'chain', 'management', 'practices', 'effective', 'collaborative', 'communication', 'strategies', 'likewise', 'relationship', 'could', 'established', 'regarding', 'shared', 'understanding', 'senior', 'junior', 'levels', 'leadership', 'regarding', 'effective', 'collaborative', 'communication', 'effective', 'supply', 'chain', 'management']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Defining and using the subject matter expert's role in transforming Army training and education programs,"The United States Army is a complex and diverse organization that must keep pace with the changing global environment to meet its Constitutional responsibility to fight and win the nation’s wars. Today, organizations, doctrine, logistics, material, facilities, concepts, techniques, procedures, and training and education are all changing to meet the Army’s requirements to fight in the new global war on terrorism. Given the complex nature of the Army and the transformation that is occurring, constant training and education is required to keep pace and to meet the Army’s evolving mission requirements. The traditional training and education model for the U.S. Army is insufficient to meet the meet the demands of the contemporary operational environment characterized by rapid technological insertions and a volatile global political situation (Cianciolo, 2007). The Army leadership wants all soldiers to engage in learning wherever they are located (Byrnes, 2003). In response, the Army is changing education and training models using a blend of resident and nonresident instruction (distributed learning) and training to keep pace with transformation and provide the training and education that meets the Army’s needs and helps maintain soldier readiness. The use of Subject Matter Experts, employing the expertise of those on the leading edge in the shifting environment the army now faces, and the expertise found in the resident Army schools with expertise from industry, academia and others that have current skills and knowledge, will help produce what the Army wants; a combat ready soldier.",305125141,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Wilson, William Rollyn",, Army-US, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2009," Social sciences , Education , Army training , Leadership , Subject matter expert", 978-1-109-67554-2,,, English, English,,,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/defining-using-subject-matter-experts-role/docview/305125141/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Defining+and+using+the+subject+matter+expert%27s+role+in+transforming+Army+training+and+education+programs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wilson%2C+William+Rollyn&amp;isbn=978-1-109-67554-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",united state army complex diverse organization must keep pace changing global environment meet constitutional responsibility fight win nation war today organization doctrine logistics material facility concept technique procedure training education changing meet army requirement fight new global war terrorism given complex nature army transformation occurring constant training education required keep pace meet army evolving mission requirement traditional training education model army insufficient meet meet demand contemporary operational environment characterized rapid technological insertion volatile global political situation cianciolo army leadership want soldier engage learning wherever located byrnes response army changing education training model using blend resident nonresident instruction distributed learning training keep pace transformation provide training education meet army need help maintain soldier readiness use subject matter expert employing expertise leading edge shifting environment army face expertise found resident army school expertise industry academia others current skill knowledge help produce army want combat ready soldier,"['united', 'states', 'army', 'complex', 'diverse', 'organization', 'must', 'keep', 'pace', 'changing', 'global', 'environment', 'meet', 'constitutional', 'responsibility', 'fight', 'win', 'nation', 'wars', 'today', 'organizations', 'doctrine', 'logistics', 'material', 'facilities', 'concepts', 'techniques', 'procedures', 'training', 'education', 'changing', 'meet', 'army', 'requirements', 'fight', 'new', 'global', 'war', 'terrorism', 'given', 'complex', 'nature', 'army', 'transformation', 'occurring', 'constant', 'training', 'education', 'required', 'keep', 'pace', 'meet', 'army', 'evolving', 'mission', 'requirements', 'traditional', 'training', 'education', 'model', 'army', 'insufficient', 'meet', 'meet', 'demands', 'contemporary', 'operational', 'environment', 'characterized', 'rapid', 'technological', 'insertions', 'volatile', 'global', 'political', 'situation', 'cianciolo', 'army', 'leadership', 'wants', 'soldiers', 'engage', 'learning', 'wherever', 'located', 'byrnes', 'response', 'army', 'changing', 'education', 'training', 'models', 'using', 'blend', 'resident', 'nonresident', 'instruction', 'distributed', 'learning', 'training', 'keep', 'pace', 'transformation', 'provide', 'training', 'education', 'meets', 'army', 'needs', 'helps', 'maintain', 'soldier', 'readiness', 'use', 'subject', 'matter', 'experts', 'employing', 'expertise', 'leading', 'edge', 'shifting', 'environment', 'army', 'faces', 'expertise', 'found', 'resident', 'army', 'schools', 'expertise', 'industry', 'academia', 'others', 'current', 'skills', 'knowledge', 'help', 'produce', 'army', 'wants', 'combat', 'ready', 'soldier']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Continuous Learning
Optoelectronic three-dimensional tracking system for collision risk model,"The purpose of this dissertation is to develop a new, novel and low cost three-dimensional tracking system that can produce a Time and Space Position Information (TSPI) database for developing an FAA Collision Risk Model (CRM) for the final phase of flight. This Collision Risk Model TSPI database will then help the FAA define a better and safer Terminal En-Route Procedures (TERPS) for air-traffic control in the National Air Space (NSA). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has attempted to develop a simple and economic solution to analyze the approaching aircraft's behavior during the time immediately after leaving the instrument approach to landing, in the visual segment, during Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Normally FAA could use laser or radar tracking, but it is expensive, does not acquire sufficient data for a meaningful analysis, and is hampered by the weather itself. The reason this tracking technique is being researched is that little is known of the aircraft's behavior upon leaving the instrument segment of flight in IMC conditions and transitioning to a visual form of flight to the touch down point during a landing. The new CRM tracking system uses a pair of stationary CCD cameras to record the landing lights of the approaching aircrafts at two sides of the runway. The concept is to apply the left and right pictures from the two cameras to create a stereoscopic image. The stereoscopic images are then used to triangulate the position of the approaching aircraft, which becomes their TSPI data. Every CRM tracking system on a runway includes two CRM tracking units and links to a central CRM data base server computer by GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) wireless network. The CRM system is new and novel concept and is the first successful low cost attempt to visually track a high speed approaching aircraft. The system satisfies the requirement to provide a large volume of track data on an area of the approach that had not been examined for the risk for collision of each type of aircraft on final approach after leaving IMC condition. Controller and pilot error in the critical phase of flight can be determined in order to implement new FAA procedures for the final approach to landing. This CRM tracking system has proved its functional integrity and has successfully produced high accurate TSPI data for the FAA at the University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airpark (KOUN) and Oklahoma City Will Rogers World Airport (KOKC). This dissertation discusses the details of the CRM tracking system concept, implementation, including software and hardware development. This dissertation also includes the system's function development, calibration, and system definition errors as well as a sample of the data produced by the new system.",304971881,,,Dissertations &

A framework for implementing systems engineering development of complex systems,"The Department of Defense and the aerospace industry are responsible for decades of successful implementation of systems engineering process models used for the development of complex systems. The process models implemented throughout acquisition life cycles have proven to be comprehensive and flexible, and hence are designed to reduce acquisition schedule variability and the inherent risks of life-cycle cost overruns. While implementing the appropriate process model is important, various process models do not evaluate and quantify potential technical, manufacturing, scheduling and cost risks that may impact acquisition activities throughout the acquisition life cycle of the complex system. A potential way to effectively manage these risks with the appropriate process model is through the incorporation of the Synthesized Framework , the proposed method developed in this dissertation. With the described Synthesized Framework (SF), process models and risk drivers can be analyzed using this comprehensive approach, which implements qualitative and quantitative risk analysis techniques through Monte Carlo simulation. The result is a repeatable, inherent, risk-driven commitment process that can stabilize and synchronize both systems engineering and acquisition processes.",304881691,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Brunson, Karl Leonard",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2009," Applied sciences , Acquisition process , Aerospace engineering , Program management , Risk management , System development , Systems engineering", 978-1-109-43262-6,,, English, English,,,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/framework-implementing-systems-engineering/docview/304881691/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+framework+for+implementing+systems+engineering+development+of+complex+systems&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brunson%2C+Karl+Leonard&amp;isbn=978-1-109-43262-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,aerospace industry responsible decade successful implementation system engineering process model used development complex system process model implemented throughout acquisition life cycle proven comprehensive flexible hence designed reduce acquisition schedule variability inherent risk cost overrun implementing appropriate process model important various process model evaluate quantify potential technical manufacturing scheduling cost risk may impact acquisition activity throughout acquisition life cycle complex system potential way effectively manage risk appropriate process model incorporation synthesized framework proposed developed described synthesized framework process model risk driver analyzed using comprehensive implement qualitative quantitative risk technique monte carlo simulation repeatable inherent commitment process stabilize synchronize system engineering acquisition process,"['aerospace', 'industry', 'responsible', 'decades', 'successful', 'implementation', 'systems', 'engineering', 'process', 'models', 'used', 'development', 'complex', 'systems', 'process', 'models', 'implemented', 'throughout', 'acquisition', 'life', 'cycles', 'proven', 'comprehensive', 'flexible', 'hence', 'designed', 'reduce', 'acquisition', 'schedule', 'variability', 'inherent', 'risks', 'cost', 'overruns', 'implementing', 'appropriate', 'process', 'model', 'important', 'various', 'process', 'models', 'evaluate', 'quantify', 'potential', 'technical', 'manufacturing', 'scheduling', 'cost', 'risks', 'may', 'impact', 'acquisition', 'activities', 'throughout', 'acquisition', 'life', 'cycle', 'complex', 'system', 'potential', 'way', 'effectively', 'manage', 'risks', 'appropriate', 'process', 'model', 'incorporation', 'synthesized', 'framework', 'proposed', 'developed', 'dissertation', 'described', 'synthesized', 'framework', 'process', 'models', 'risk', 'drivers', 'analyzed', 'using', 'comprehensive', 'implements', 'qualitative', 'quantitative', 'risk', 'techniques', 'monte', 'carlo', 'simulation', 'result', 'repeatable', 'inherent', 'commitment', 'process', 'stabilize', 'synchronize', 'systems', 'engineering', 'acquisition', 'processes']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
Regression analysis of automatic measurement systems,"The Department of Defense (DoD) testing methodology for the evaluation and acceptance between existing and emerging automatic measurement systems are based on qualitative (PASS/FAIL) criteria of the automatic measurement systems responses when testing of a unit-under-test. Acceptance of a unit-under-test, based on qualitative responses, is contingent upon accurate measurements by the automatic measurement system. This dissertation presents a regression analysis methodology for evaluating the performance between automatic measurement systems that are functionally equivalent but technologically different. The motivation for this research is to advance regression analysis techniques in the transportability of unit-under-tests between current and emerging measurement systems. Given the acquisition cost, schedule and technical challenges in developing new systems, this methodology will provide increased confidence for the acquisition community to make informed decisions about the capability of future automatic measurement systems. The regression analysis methodology presented, quantitatively analyzes the parametric responses by functionally decomposing the automatic measurement systems to their lowest functional capability, and subsequently integrates the total automated measurement system for a unit-under-test's parametric responses.",304880219,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Flynn, Michael J.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2009," Applied sciences , Automatic test equipment , Exploratory data analysis , Measurment systems , Regression analysis , Systems analysis", 978-1-109-04935-0,,, English, English,,,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/regression-analysis-automatic-measurement-systems/docview/304880219/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Regression+analysis+of+automatic+measurement+systems&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Flynn%2C+Michael+J.&amp;isbn=978-1-109-04935-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,testing evaluation acceptance existing emerging automatic measurement system based qualitative criterion automatic measurement system response testing acceptance based qualitative response contingent upon accurate measurement automatic measurement system present regression evaluating performance automatic measurement system functionally equivalent technologically different motivation advance regression technique transportability current emerging measurement system given acquisition cost schedule technical challenge developing new system provide increased confidence acquisition community make informed decision capability future automatic measurement system regression presented quantitatively analyzes parametric response functionally decomposing automatic measurement system lowest functional capability subsequently integrates total automated measurement system parametric response,"['testing', 'evaluation', 'acceptance', 'existing', 'emerging', 'automatic', 'measurement', 'systems', 'based', 'qualitative', 'criteria', 'automatic', 'measurement', 'systems', 'responses', 'testing', 'acceptance', 'based', 'qualitative', 'responses', 'contingent', 'upon', 'accurate', 'measurements', 'automatic', 'measurement', 'system', 'dissertation', 'presents', 'regression', 'evaluating', 'performance', 'automatic', 'measurement', 'systems', 'functionally', 'equivalent', 'technologically', 'different', 'motivation', 'advance', 'regression', 'techniques', 'transportability', 'current', 'emerging', 'measurement', 'systems', 'given', 'acquisition', 'cost', 'schedule', 'technical', 'challenges', 'developing', 'new', 'systems', 'provide', 'increased', 'confidence', 'acquisition', 'community', 'make', 'informed', 'decisions', 'capability', 'future', 'automatic', 'measurement', 'systems', 'regression', 'presented', 'quantitatively', 'analyzes', 'parametric', 'responses', 'functionally', 'decomposing', 'automatic', 'measurement', 'systems', 'lowest', 'functional', 'capability', 'subsequently', 'integrates', 'total', 'automated', 'measurement', 'system', 'parametric', 'responses']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Continuous Learning

Visual Programming in a Heterogeneous Multi-Core Environment,"É do conhecimento geral de que, hoje em dia, a tecnologia evolui rapidamente. São criadas novas arquitecturas para resolver determinadas limitações ou problemas. Por vezes, essa evolução é pacífica e não requer necessidade de adaptação e, por outras, essa evolução pode Implicar mudanças. As linguagens de programação são, desde sempre, o principal elo de comunicação entre o programador e o computador. Novas linguagens continuam a aparecer e outras estão sempre em desenvolvimento para se adaptarem a novos conceitos e paradigmas. Isto requer um esforço extra para o programador, que tem de estar sempre atento a estas mudanças. A Programação Visual pode ser uma solução para este problema. Exprimir funções como módulos que recebem determinado Input e retomam determinado output poderá ajudar os programadores espalhados pelo mundo, através da possibilidade de lhes dar uma margem para se abstraírem de pormenores de baixo nível relacionados com uma arquitectura específica.

Hypoxic transcription gene profiles under the modulation of nitric oxide in nuclear run on-microarray and proteomics,"Doc number: 408 Abstract Background: Microarray analysis still is a powerful tool to identify new components of the transcriptosome. It helps to increase the knowledge of targets triggered by stress conditions such as hypoxia and nitric oxide. However, analysis of transcriptional regulatory events remain elusive due to the contribution of altered mRNA stability to gene expression patterns as well as changes in the half-life of mRNAs, which influence mRNA expression levels and their turn over rates. To circumvent these problems, we have focused on the analysis of newly transcribed (nascent) mRNAs by nuclear run on (NRO), followed by microarray analysis. Results: We identified 196 genes that were significantly regulated by hypoxia, 85 genes affected by nitric oxide and 292 genes induced by the cotreatment of macrophages with both NO and hypoxia. Fourteen genes (Bnip3, Ddit4, Vegfa, Trib3, Atf3, Cdkn1a, Scd1, D4Ertd765e, Sesn2, Son, Nnt, Lst1, Hps6 and Fxyd5) were common to all treatments but with different levels of expression in each group. We observed that 162 transcripts were regulated only when cells were co-treated with hypoxia and NO but not with either treatment alone, pointing to the importance of a crosstalk between hypoxia and NO. In addition, both array and proteomics data supported a consistent repression of hypoxia-regulated targets by NO. Conclusion: By eliminating the interference of steady state mRNA in gene expression profiling, we obtained a smaller number of significantly regulated transcripts in our study compared to published microarray data and identified previously unknown hypoxia-induced targets. Gene analysis profiling corroborated the interplay between NO- and hypoxia-induced signaling.",1651240095,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Igwe, Emeka I;Essler, Silke;Al-Furoukh, Natalie;Dehne, Nathalie;Brüne, Bernhard",,," © 2009 Igwe et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Application of Systems Engineering Processes to DOD Science and Technology Research and Development Projects,"System Engineering concepts have been successfully applied within the US Department of Defense (DoD) to manufacturing engineering development and management support programs for over four decades. For more than a decade Systems Engineering has been advocated within the DoD as a means to guide the early stages of development of advanced technologies to improve the transition from the laboratory to manufacturing. The concept is that, by improving the quality of decisions during the advanced development stages, subsequent insertion of new technologies into DoD projects is much more likely to meet project requirements while better managing overall cost and schedule performance. The objective of this research was to gain greater understanding of the perceived benefit of Systems Engineering in general, and of 43 specific Systems Engineering methods, processes, and tools described in DoD training and in the literature, as applied to the management of DoD 6.2, applied research and 6.3, advanced technology development, R&amp;D projects. Data for the analysis were collected by a survey of government and government contractor professionals involved in DoD acquisition. The findings show support for and recognition of the use of Systems Engineering in R&amp;D projects and provide a ranking of the 43 methods.",1079135238,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Lemaster, George E.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2009," Applied sciences , Department of Defense , R and d projects , Systems engineering , Transition from the laboratory to manufacturing", 978-1-267-58611-7,,, English, English,,,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/application-systems-engineering-processes-dod/docview/1079135238/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Application+of+Systems+Engineering+Processes+to+DOD+Science+and+Technology+Research+and+Development+Projects&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lemaster%2C+George+E.&amp;isbn=978-1-267-58611-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,system engineering concept successfully applied within manufacturing engineering development management support program four decade decade system engineering advocated within mean guide early stage development advanced technology improve transition laboratory manufacturing concept improving quality decision advanced development stage subsequent insertion new technology project much likely meet project requirement better managing overall cost schedule performance objective gain greater understanding perceived benefit system engineering general specific system engineering method process tool described training literature applied management applied advanced technology development amp project collected survey government government contractor professional involved acquisition finding show support recognition use system engineering amp project provide ranking method,"['system', 'engineering', 'concepts', 'successfully', 'applied', 'within', 'manufacturing', 'engineering', 'development', 'management', 'support', 'programs', 'four', 'decades', 'decade', 'systems', 'engineering', 'advocated', 'within', 'means', 'guide', 'early', 'stages', 'development', 'advanced', 'technologies', 'improve', 'transition', 'laboratory', 'manufacturing', 'concept', 'improving', 'quality', 'decisions', 'advanced', 'development', 'stages', 'subsequent', 'insertion', 'new', 'technologies', 'projects', 'much', 'likely', 'meet', 'project', 'requirements', 'better', 'managing', 'overall', 'cost', 'schedule', 'performance', 'objective', 'gain', 'greater', 'understanding', 'perceived', 'benefit', 'systems', 'engineering', 'general', 'specific', 'systems', 'engineering', 'methods', 'processes', 'tools', 'described', 'training', 'literature', 'applied', 'management', 'applied', 'advanced', 'technology', 'development', 'amp', 'projects', 'data', 'collected', 'survey', 'government', 'government', 'contractor', 'professionals', 'involved', 'acquisition', 'findings', 'show', 'support', 'recognition', 'use', 'systems', 'engineering', 'amp', 'projects', 'provide', 'ranking', 'methods']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Management and Leadership
Reforming Financial Management at the DEPARTMENT of DEFENSE,"In February 1995, the General Accounting Office (GAO -- now the Government Accountability Office) issued a brief report in its High-Risk Series, identifying the six federal government agencies or operations considered most vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement. Prominent on that list was the Department of Defense (DoD), where financial management problems continued despite repeated audit findings over the years. Through the use of metrics and modern financial management tools, DoD is producing better financial information in every part of its organization, which is leading to measurable results in the way government is managed and taxpayer moneys are spent. DoD is achieving improved performance by investing in new financial accounting systems. Progress toward a DoD-wide clean audit is one of the department's most significant financial management accomplishments.

"408 PERMISSION AND 404 PERMIT TO SACRAMENTO AREA FLOOD CONTROL AGENCY FOR THE NATOMAS LEVEE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT, SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA. [Part 2 of 4]","PURPOSE: The early implementation of improvements to the perimeter levee system within the Natomas Basin in Sutter and Sacramento counties, California is proposed. The 53,000-acre basin extends from the confluence of the American and Sacramento rivers northward from the American River and includes portions of the city of Sacramento as well as portions of the two abovementioned counties. In addition to the American and Sacramento rivers on the south and west of the basin, the basin is bordered on the north by Natomas Cross Canal (NCC) and on the east by Pleasant Grove Creek Canal (PGCC) and the Natomas East Main Drainage Canal. The Natomas Basin perimeter levee system was originally created to promote agricultural development within the basin. Flood control has historically been a major concern to agricultural and urban settlers in the Sacramento River basin due to the unique topographical and meteorological factors that make the basin capable of generating very high peak flood discharges. The Natomas Basin is also the site of extensive urban development and the Sacramento International Airport. The basin's remaining agricultural habitat for a number of special wildlife and fish species. Currently proposed improvements would alter the constituent levees such that the system would meet 100-year flood containment criteria developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), design criteria used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state of Arizona for levees comprising the Common Features Project, and design 200-year water surface elevations developed by the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency. Four alternatives, including a No Action Alternative, are considered in this draft EIS. In addition to the levee improvements, the plan would include associated landscape and irrigation/drainage infrastructure modifications. The action alternatives address means of achieving early implementation of the project in its entirety, with the 2008 construction phase addressed in detail and the 2009 and 2010 phases addressed at a general, programmatic level. The preferred alternative (Alternative 1) would include levee raising and seepage remediation along the NCC south levee, the Sacramento River east levee and the PGCC; erosion control throughout the Natomas Basin System; improvements to major irrigation and drainage infrastructure; habitat creation and management, particularly with respect to habitat for giant garter snake and Swainson's hawk; removal of encroachments from a portion of the water and land size of the Sacramento River; modification the State Route 99/70 crossing of the NCC as necessary to meet FEMA requirements; acquisition of rights-of-way through fee title or easement interest within the project footprint, at borrow sites, and within the flood control system. POSITIVE IMPACTS: Any substantial increase in expected annual damaged as new urban development occurred would be minimized or avoided. The flood control projects in the vicinity of the airport would facilitate changes in the management of airport lands that would reduce hazards to aviation safety and use flood control projects to increase the extent of connectivity of lands in Natomas being managed to provide habitat for giant garter snake, Swainson's hawk, and other special-status species. NEGATIVE IMPACTS: A large number of mature trees would be removed from the land side of the Sacramento River east levee, degrading visual aesthetics in the area. Under one alternative, removal of a substantial acreage of mature trees from the water side of the Sacramento River levee would add to the significant visual impact and would also result in loss of wildlife corridors, Swainson's hawk nesting, and shaded riverine aquatic habitat; these impacts, however, would not result from the preferred alternative. Transportation of borrow materials would significant increases truck traffic and the associated emission of air pollutants within the local roadway network in Sutter County during project implementation.

Logistics Transformation: DoD's Opportunity to Partner with the Private Sector - A Time for Action,"  Ongoing initiatives include: * Outsourcing of commercially available consumables and reliance on existing commercial supply chains for items such as food, fuel, tires, shop materials, compressed gas and medical supplies. * Use of corporate contracts for weapon system unique consumable items. * Purchase of weapon system readiness or equipment availability as a performance outcome from equipment manufacturers (rather than purchase of spare parts on an as needed basis). * Use of commercial partnering and continuous process improvement techniques that enhance operations throughout the DoD logistics enterprise and reduce costs at maintenance facilities. * Designation of USTRANSCOM as the DoD Distribution Process Owner to integrate the end-to-end distribution process. * Migration of repairables procurement to DLA to consolidate buying power as part of the Base ReAlignment and Closure (BRAC). * Consolidation of supply storage and distribution within DLA to eliminate redundant retail inventories and enhance end-to-end visibility. * Implementation of corporate contracts and strategic supplier agreements by DLA to improve demand forecasting and reduce lead times with major suppliers. * Application of active and passive radio frequency identification and unique item identification to enhance end-to-end asset visibility. * Increasing reliance on the private sector for non-combat in-theater support. For example: * DLA has improved material availability to almost 100% and reduced lead-times to 24-48 hours using commercial supply chains for food, medical items and shop materials.6 * Military Services have dramatically improved weapon system availability, reduced lead-times from 50 days to 4 days and dramatically reduced costs through Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contracts with industry.7 * The DoD has reduced average customer wait time from 24 days to 16 days through better integration of their end-to-end distribution process and improved asset visibility.8 * DoD industrial facilities have implemented continuous process improvement initiatives that have cut repair time by over 50%.9 The DoD's realization of benefits from partnering with the private sector reflects two

"Organizational learning, leadership and culture: A study of program managers in the Department of Defense",The purpose of this study was to explore how Department of Defense (DOD) program manager perceptions of organizational learning and the influence of transformational leadership style on those perceptions affect weapon acquisition. The results of this study suggest several important findings including that a knowledge gap exists in DOD program manager understanding of organizational learning; DOD program managers are not using organizational learning strategies to affect the DOD weapon acquisition culture; and DOD program managers have adopted a conceptual framework regarding learning. Studying DOD program managers' perceptions of organizational learning and the influence of transformational leadership style on how those perceptions affect weapon acquisition represents is an important step in increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the populations work.,304832556,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Newberry, David B.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2008," Social sciences , Culture , Department of Defense , Leadership , Organizational learning , Program managers , Transformational leadership", 978-0-549-39843-1,,, English, English,,,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/organizational-learning-leadership-culture-study/docview/304832556/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Organizational+learning%2C+leadership+and+culture%3A+A+study+of+program+managers+in+the+Department+of+Defense&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Newberry%2C+David+B.&amp;isbn=978-0-549-39843-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",purpose explore program manager perception organizational learning influence transformational leadership style perception affect weapon acquisition result suggest several important finding including knowledge gap exists program manager understanding organizational learning program manager using organizational learning strategy affect weapon acquisition culture program manager adopted conceptual framework regarding learning studying program manager perception organizational learning influence transformational leadership style perception affect weapon acquisition represents important step increasing efficiency effectiveness population work,"['purpose', 'explore', 'program', 'manager', 'perceptions', 'organizational', 'learning', 'influence', 'transformational', 'leadership', 'style', 'perceptions', 'affect', 'weapon', 'acquisition', 'results', 'suggest', 'several', 'important', 'findings', 'including', 'knowledge', 'gap', 'exists', 'program', 'manager', 'understanding', 'organizational', 'learning', 'program', 'managers', 'using', 'organizational', 'learning', 'strategies', 'affect', 'weapon', 'acquisition', 'culture', 'program', 'managers', 'adopted', 'conceptual', 'framework', 'regarding', 'learning', 'studying', 'program', 'managers', 'perceptions', 'organizational', 'learning', 'influence', 'transformational', 'leadership', 'style', 'perceptions', 'affect', 'weapon', 'acquisition', 'represents', 'important', 'step', 'increasing', 'efficiency', 'effectiveness', 'populations', 'work']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
"Army leadership and human resource processes to attract, retain, reward, and develop a civilian workforce","This study focuses on the difficult issues that the leadership of the Department of the Army is confronting the following concerns: attracting, retaining, rewarding, and developing a civilian workforce that is able to exceed mission demands with shrinking resources. This case study was established with the primary source of information being the National Defense Act, Government Accounting Office reports, papers, and speeches presented by high-ranking government officials, academia, and private sector experts. Review of literature from the government and private sector provides the database that displays knowledge concerning a civilian workforce that can be developed, acquired, and sustained. In addition the framework of a case study provides a flexible design that unfolds as the research proceeds. The survey includes such topics as: tenure, roles, certification, values, education, culture, teaming, and implementation factors with other topics that are relevant to a civilian workforce.

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 2012: A phenomenological case study of organizational change in the headquarters of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,"This phenomenological study examined the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), a Major Army Command of over 32,000 personnel with a presence in over 90 countries worldwide and the entire United States, during its reorganization process known as USACE 2012, the intent of which was to realign the USACE for its ideal future by the year 2012. This study analyzed whether the change and decision processes ultimately utilized to develop organizational structure recommendations for approval by USACE leadership followed the precepts of USACE 2012 and identified the resultant impacts of managerial changes on the USACE internal security organization. It determined whether the processes were uniformly applied across the entire organization in accordance with USACE 2012 policy and if a systems approach in the form of in-depth process reviews were utilized as a basis for developing recommendations for leadership concerning the organizational structure. A supplementary objective examined the consequences of these recommendations and evaluated their effect on the security program. It examined whether the organizational realignment of the internal security organization, in accordance with the USACE 2012 policy, produced the intended results and enhanced the security mission. This was done by gathering data from in-depth interviews of 15 USACE senior leaders, members of various committees, and security personnel who were directly or indirectly involved in the organizational realignment of the internal security organization. The instrumentation utilized for this study was a set of semi-structured questions used by the interviewer during face-to-face interviews. The resultant study found that the purpose of the 2012 reorganization was not clear to all command personnel. Further the study demonstrated that the processes utilized to make organizational recommendations were not uniformly applied across the organization. In-depth process reviews were conducted only to a limited extent and in some cases not at all. But perhaps the most profound result was the determination that the organization placement of the various security entities within the headquarters was based virtually entirely on a lack of understanding of the security mission by those making organization recommendations to USACE leadership. This study has implications for other large military organizations considering reorganization.",304831554,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Fleming, Kenneth M.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest

Exploring business model efficiency on U.S. Air Force information technology investment management,"Despite the recent emergence of numerous corporate information technology (IT) business efficiency models, there exists no systematic approach towards optimizing the efficiency of IT resources and their operational effectiveness within the unique environment of the Department of Defense (DOD) and U.S. Air Force (USAF) investment management. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of select DOD IT business models on USAF IT investment management, the study included a qualitative, descriptive approach to the USAF IT investment management that included DOD IT business efficiency model characteristics and attributes and select project management controls associated with the USAF IT investment management process. Analysis of the data revealed that the USAF was not effectively structured to promote the efficiency of its IT investment management strategies. Further, research data survey results confirmed numerous government reports that few project management controls currently exist at the lower levels of IT investment management, impacting strategic decision-making and the effective implementation of a USAF and DOD enterprise architecture resulting in significant loss of returns on investment capital. Data from this study should yield direct application not only to the USAF and DOD IT project management and investment-management communities, but also to component services and other government and federal IT and acquisitions organizations.",304823276,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Lang, Kenneth Marvin",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2008," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Air Force , Business , Business model , Efficiency , Information technology , Investment management , U.S. Air Force , United States", 978-0-549-96469-8,,, English, English,,,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploring-business-model-efficiency-on-u-s-air/docview/304823276/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploring+business+model+efficiency+on+U.S.+Air+Force+information+technology+investment+management&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lang%2C+Kenneth+Marvin&amp;isbn=978-0-549-96469-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",despite recent emergence numerous corporate information technology business efficiency model exists systematic towards optimizing efficiency resource operational effectiveness within unique environment air force usaf investment management order evaluate effectiveness select business model usaf investment management included qualitative descriptive usaf investment management included business efficiency model characteristic attribute select project management control associated usaf investment management process revealed usaf effectively structured promote efficiency investment management strategy survey result confirmed numerous government report project management control currently exist lower level investment management impacting strategic effective implementation usaf enterprise architecture resulting significant loss return investment capital yield direct application usaf project management community also component service government federal acquisition organization,"['despite', 'recent', 'emergence', 'numerous', 'corporate', 'information', 'technology', 'business', 'efficiency', 'models', 'exists', 'systematic', 'towards', 'optimizing', 'efficiency', 'resources', 'operational', 'effectiveness', 'within', 'unique', 'environment', 'air', 'force', 'usaf', 'investment', 'management', 'order', 'evaluate', 'effectiveness', 'select', 'business', 'models', 'usaf', 'investment', 'management', 'included', 'qualitative', 'descriptive', 'usaf', 'investment', 'management', 'included', 'business', 'efficiency', 'model', 'characteristics', 'attributes', 'select', 'project', 'management', 'controls', 'associated', 'usaf', 'investment', 'management', 'process', 'data', 'revealed', 'usaf', 'effectively', 'structured', 'promote', 'efficiency', 'investment', 'management', 'strategies', 'data', 'survey', 'results', 'confirmed', 'numerous', 'government', 'reports', 'project', 'management', 'controls', 'currently', 'exist', 'lower', 'levels', 'investment', 'management', 'impacting', 'strategic', 'effective', 'implementation', 'usaf', 'enterprise', 'architecture', 'resulting', 'significant', 'loss', 'returns', 'investment', 'capital', 'data', 'yield', 'direct', 'application', 'usaf', 'project', 'management', 'communities', 'also', 'component', 'services', 'government', 'federal', 'acquisitions', 'organizations']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
Comparing leadership competencies of U.S. Army Generals and U.S. Army civilian senior executives: A case study,"The objective of this study was to indentify similarities and differences in leadership competencies between United States Army Generals and members of the Senior Executive Service employed by the Department of the Army. Using the Lominger Leadership Architect® Competency Sort Cards and personal structured interviews, the study examined the leadership competencies of two groups. The study revealed that organizational culture and upbringing, in either regards to all military, all civilian, or a combination of experiences, impacts leadership competencies differently between civilian Senior Executive Service (SES) members and military General Officers (GO) of the United States Army. There were three primary findings related to both civilian and military leaders. For the civilian members, negotiating is noted as a skilled competency whereas managing personal disclosure is a challenge. For the military, ethics and values is a priority whereas hiring and staffing is a non-issue. Both groups in the study express that leaders want the best connection wit subordinates and colleagues. The study concludes with a discussion of how leadership training and development programs could be enhanced through the further exploration of competencies of leaders by a 360-degree approach and other venues to increase leader development programs of the United States Army.",304822073,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Weaver, Jeffrey S.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2008," Social sciences , Civilian , General officer , Generals , Leadership , Senior Executive Service , United States Army", 978-0-549-89412-4,,, English, English,,,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comparing-leadership-competencies-u-s-army/docview/304822073/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Comparing+leadership+competencies+of+U.S.+Army+Generals+and+U.S.+Army+civilian+senior+executives%3A+A+case+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Weaver%2C+Jeffrey+S.&amp;isbn=978-0-549-89412-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",objective indentify similarity difference leadership competency united state army general member senior executive service employed army using lominger leadership competency sort card personal structured interview examined leadership competency two group revealed organizational culture upbringing either regard civilian combination experience impact leadership competency differently civilian senior executive service s member general officer united state army three primary finding related civilian leader civilian member negotiating noted skilled competency whereas managing personal disclosure challenge ethic value priority whereas hiring staffing group express leader want best connection wit subordinate colleague concludes discussion leadership training development program could enhanced exploration competency leader venue increase leader development program united state army,"['objective', 'indentify', 'similarities', 'differences', 'leadership', 'competencies', 'united', 'states', 'army', 'generals', 'members', 'senior', 'executive', 'service', 'employed', 'army', 'using', 'lominger', 'leadership', 'competency', 'sort', 'cards', 'personal', 'structured', 'interviews', 'examined', 'leadership', 'competencies', 'two', 'groups', 'revealed', 'organizational', 'culture', 'upbringing', 'either', 'regards', 'civilian', 'combination', 'experiences', 'impacts', 'leadership', 'competencies', 'differently', 'civilian', 'senior', 'executive', 'service', 'ses', 'members', 'general', 'officers', 'united', 'states', 'army', 'three', 'primary', 'findings', 'related', 'civilian', 'leaders', 'civilian', 'members', 'negotiating', 'noted', 'skilled', 'competency', 'whereas', 'managing', 'personal', 'disclosure', 'challenge', 'ethics', 'values', 'priority', 'whereas', 'hiring', 'staffing', 'groups', 'express', 'leaders', 'want', 'best', 'connection', 'wit', 'subordinates', 'colleagues', 'concludes', 'discussion', 'leadership', 'training', 'development', 'programs', 'could', 'enhanced', 'exploration', 'competencies', 'leaders', 'venues', 'increase', 'leader', 'development', 'programs', 'united', 'states', 'army']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Enterprise resource planning implementations within the U.S. Department of Defense: The effectiveness of department and individual programmatic governance in improving data and information environment quality,"Within the private sector, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have been demonstrated as optimizing strategic benefits to enterprises. The benefits of these systems are derived from their ability to integrate functionally aligned legacy systems into end-to-end enterprise-focused processes and consolidate multiple data stores into single instances. These benefits have provided the foundation for ERP implementations to become transformational initiatives that have realigned organizational processes, making vertically aligned processes horizontally aligned. These transformational initiatives have improved the quality of data and information environments, providing data and information as enterprise assets. ERPs have allowed trading partnerships to be linked to integrated supply chains that have increased operating efficiencies. These demonstrated advantages have been the principal motivating factor for the Department of Defense (DoD) to expend a large portion of its IT budget on the implementation of ERP applications. Governance is a critical enabler of successful ERP implementations within the private sector. Similarly, the DoD has governance structures to oversee ERP implementations. This research sought to begin filling this gap in the knowledge by seeking a causal relationship between the DoD's ERP implementations, governance, and effects on data and system quality using a mixed methods approach. Because of an absence of grounded research, this project used an exploratory research paradigm to seek pretheory findings. Consistent with this paradigm, this project used the statistical approach of structured equation modeling for the quantitative phase, which supported the alternative hypotheses. The qualitative phase of this project used publicly available Government Accountability Office reports to compare ERP preimplementation conditions of data and information system quality with postimplementation quality. This research identified a positive correlation between the ERP implementations and the governance structure within the DOD, as well as emerging data on their positive effects on data and information environment quality. This research extended the framework grounded in private industry into the public sector of the DoD through the hypothetical model. Additional research must be conducted to establish theory from the basis of the pretheory work of this research.",304815282,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Jacobsen, David A.",,, Database copyright

The economics of enterprise transformation: An analysis of the defense acquisition system,"Despite nearly 50 years of attempts at reform, the US defense acquisition system continues to deliver weapon systems over budget, behind schedule, and with performance shortfalls. A parade of commissions, panels, and oversight organizations have studied and restudied the problems of government acquisition with the objective of transforming the defense acquisition enterprise, yet the resulting legislative and procedural changes have yielded little, if any, benefit. Thus, the obvious question is why has acquisition reform failed? Three potential contributors were identified in the literature: misalignment of incentives, a lack of a systems view, and a lack of objective evaluation criteria. This dissertation attempts to address each of these problem areas. First, I consider the issue of incentivization in the context of defense technology policy. A frequent criticism of defense acquisition programs is that they tend to employ risky, immature technology that increases the cost and duration of acquisition efforts. To combat this problem the Department of Defense rewrote their acquisition regulations to encourage a more evolutionary approach to system development. Nominally, this requires the use of mature technologies, but studies have revealed that acquisition programs continue to use immature technologies in spite of the new policies. To analyze this issue, the defense acquisition cycle was modeled as a stochastic process. Then, assuming that each acquisition program serves a diverse set of stakeholders, game theory was applied to show that the stable solution is to employ immature technology. It turns out that there is a tragedy of the commons at work in which the acquisition program serves as the common resource for each of the stakeholder groups to achieve its objectives. Since there is no cost to using the resource, there is a tendency to overexploit it. The result is an outcome that is worse than if there had been a coordinated solution. Thus, the rational actions of stakeholders will lead to a contradiction of acquisition policy. Consequently, if the Department of Defense expects adherence to its evolutionary acquisition policy it must either strictly enforce technology maturity requirements or else realign incentives with desired outcomes. Second, I evaluate cost and performance implications of the most recent defense acquisition transformation initiative, evolutionary acquisition. Proponents suggest that evolutionary acquisition will lower acquisition program costs, shorten delivery times, and improve the performance of fielded systems through the use of shorter and more incremental acquisition cycles. Supporting arguments focus on the impact of evolutionary acquisition on individual programs but fail to consider the defense acquisition enterprise as a system. To address this shortcoming, I analyze the impact of evolutionary policies through the use of a discrete event simulation of the entire defense acquisition system. It was found that while there should be an increase in the performance of fielded systems under evolutionary acquisition policies, the cost of operating the defense acquisition system as a whole does not inherently decrease. This is because the shorter acquisition cycles created by evolutionary polices mean that the overhead costs of each acquisition cycle are incurred more frequently. If these overhead costs do not decline sufficiently, the net cost to operate the acquisition system rises. This finding demonstrates the importance of considering the entire acquisition system before implementing a new policy. Finally, I address the lack of objective evaluation criteria by developing a method to value acquisition process improvements monetarily. This is accomplished through the combination of price indices and options analysis. Since the US government is a non-profit entity, traditional cash flow based valuation methods are not applicable. Instead, the use of price indices captures the changes in the government's buying power induced by acquisition reforms. This may be converted into an equivalent augmented budget stream that allows traditional investment evaluation tools to be applied. An additional advantage of the buying power method is that it captures the impact of the economies of scale inherent in the production of military systems. The augmented budget stream serves as the basis for applying options analysis, which properly accounts for the risk mitigating effects of staging. A comparison of this new method with more traditional methods reveals that only considering cost savings can significantly undervalue acquisition improvement opportunities, and even small improvements can have large returns.",304645429,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Pennock, Michael J.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,

Teenagers doing history out-of-school: An intrinsic case study of situated learning in history,"This intrinsic case study documents a community-based history expedition implemented as a project-based, voluntary, out-of-school history activity. The expedition’s development was informed by the National Education Association’s concept of the intensive study of history, its structure by the history seminary, and its spirit by Webb’s account of seminar as history expedition. Specific study objectives included documentation of the planning, implementation, operation, and outcomes of the expedition, as well as the viability of the history expedition as a vehicle for engaging teenagers in the practice of history. Finally, the study examined whether a history expedition might serve as a curriculum of identity. Constructivist philosophy and situated learning theory grounded the analysis and interpretation of the study. Undertaken in North Central Texas, the study followed the experiences of six teenagers engaged as historians who were given one year to research and write a historical monograph. The monograph concerned the last horse cavalry regiment deployed overseas as a mounted combat unit by the U.S. Army during World War II. The study yielded qualitative data in the form of researcher observations, participant interviews, artifacts of participant writing, and participant speeches. In addition, the study includes evaluations of the historical monograph by subject matter experts. The data indicate that participants and audience describe the history expedition as a highly motivational experience which empowered participants to think critically, write historically, and create an original product valuable to the regiment’s veterans, the veterans’ families, the State of Texas, and military historians. The study supports the contention of the National Education Association that the intensive study of history can be beneficial both to expedition participants and to their community. The assertion that engaging teenagers as researchers within a discipline serves as a curriculum of identity was supported in the study as well. The study underscored the importance of oral history as a gateway for learning about modern history.",304556495,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Johnston, Glenn T.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2008," Social sciences , Education , Case study , Qualitative research , Interviews , Community education , Experiential learning , History , Informal learning , Situated learning", 978-0-549-79043-3,,, English, English,,,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/teenagers-doing-history-out-school-intrinsic-case/docview/304556495/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Teenagers+doing+history+out-of-school%3A+An+intrinsic+case+study+of+situated+learning+in+history&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnston%2C+Glenn+T.&amp;isbn=978-0-549-79043-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",intrinsic case document history expedition implemented voluntary history activity expedition development informed national education association concept intensive history structure history seminary spirit webb account seminar history expedition specific objective included documentation planning implementation operation outcome expedition well viability history expedition vehicle engaging teenager practice history finally examined whether history expedition might serve curriculum identity constructivist philosophy situated learning theory grounded interpretation undertaken north central texas followed experience six teenager engaged historian given one year write historical monograph monograph concerned last horse cavalry regiment deployed overseas mounted combat unit army world war yielded qualitative form researcher observation participant interview artifact participant writing participant speech addition includes evaluation historical monograph subject matter expert indicate participant audience describe history expedition highly motivational experience empowered participant think critically write historically create original product valuable regiment veteran veteran family state texas historian support contention national education association intensive history beneficial expedition participant community assertion engaging teenager researcher within discipline serf curriculum identity supported well underscored importance oral history gateway learning modern history,"['intrinsic', 'case', 'documents', 'history', 'expedition', 'implemented', 'voluntary', 'history', 'activity', 'expedition', 'development', 'informed', 'national', 'education', 'association', 'concept', 'intensive', 'history', 'structure', 'history', 'seminary', 'spirit', 'webb', 'account', 'seminar', 'history', 'expedition', 'specific', 'objectives', 'included', 'documentation', 'planning', 'implementation', 'operation', 'outcomes', 'expedition', 'well', 'viability', 'history', 'expedition', 'vehicle', 'engaging', 'teenagers', 'practice', 'history', 'finally', 'examined', 'whether', 'history', 'expedition', 'might', 'serve', 'curriculum', 'identity', 'constructivist', 'philosophy', 'situated', 'learning', 'theory', 'grounded', 'interpretation', 'undertaken', 'north', 'central', 'texas', 'followed', 'experiences', 'six', 'teenagers', 'engaged', 'historians', 'given', 'one', 'year', 'write', 'historical', 'monograph', 'monograph', 'concerned', 'last', 'horse', 'cavalry', 'regiment', 'deployed', 'overseas', 'mounted', 'combat', 'unit', 'army', 'world', 'war', 'yielded', 'qualitative', 'data', 'form', 'researcher', 'observations', 'participant', 'interviews', 'artifacts', 'participant', 'writing', 'participant', 'speeches', 'addition', 'includes', 'evaluations', 'historical', 'monograph', 'subject', 'matter', 'experts', 'data', 'indicate', 'participants', 'audience', 'describe', 'history', 'expedition', 'highly', 'motivational', 'experience', 'empowered', 'participants', 'think', 'critically', 'write', 'historically', 'create', 'original', 'product', 'valuable', 'regiment', 'veterans', 'veterans', 'families', 'state', 'texas', 'historians', 'supports', 'contention', 'national', 'education', 'association', 'intensive', 'history', 'beneficial', 'expedition', 'participants', 'community', 'assertion', 'engaging', 'teenagers', 'researchers', 'within', 'discipline', 'serves', 'curriculum', 'identity', 'supported', 'well', 'underscored', 'importance', 'oral', 'history', 'gateway', 'learning', 'modern', 'history']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Continuous Learning
Optimization models in support of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contracts,"Performance Based Logistics (PBL) is emerging as a preferred logistic support strategy within the public sector, especially the Department of Defense. Under a PBL strategy, the customer buys performance, such as operational availability, mission readiness and operational reliability, instead of contracting for a specified collection of resources defining the underlying support infrastructure. The literature on PBL is still in its infancy and additional research is required to optimize logistic resources such as spare parts, equipment, facilities, labor etc within a PBL context. Resource decisions now need to focus on profit margins as public sector contracts migrate from traditional cost plus fixed fee or fixed price to PBL contracts. The present research proposes new optimization models to determine the configuration of an operating system and the resource quantities and location comprising its support infrastructure that maximizes a supplier's profit. The first two models examine the allocation of spare resources; an item-based allocation algorithm is defined and the system-level, multi-item, multi-echelon METRIC theory (Sherbrooke 1968; Muckstadt 1973; Graves 1985; Sherbrooke 1986; Sherbrooke 2004) is extended to make it relevant to the PBL domain. Introducing the notion of profit in the new spares algorithm, coupled with its improved performance, then allows for the development of a new mathematical model to solve simultaneously the primary system's redundancy design problem and the enabling system's spares allocation problem.",304449803,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Nowicki, David Richard",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2008," Applied sciences , Inventory , Performance-based logistics , Supply chains", 978-0-549-63367-9,,, English, English,,,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/optimization-models-support-performance-based/docview/304449803/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Optimization+models+in+support+of+Performance+Based+Logistics+%28PBL%29+contracts&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nowicki%2C+David+Richard&amp;isbn=978-0-549-63367-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,performance based logistics pbl emerging preferred logistic support strategy within public sector especially pbl strategy customer buy performance operational availability mission readiness operational reliability instead contracting specified collection resource defining underlying support infrastructure literature pbl still infancy additional required optimize logistic resource spare part equipment facility labor etc within pbl context resource decision need focus profit margin public sector contract migrate traditional cost plus fixed fee fixed price pbl contract present proposes new optimization model determine configuration operating system resource quantity location comprising support infrastructure maximizes supplier profit first two model examine allocation spare resource allocation algorithm defined metric theory sherbrooke muckstadt graf sherbrooke sherbrooke extended make relevant pbl domain introducing notion profit new spare algorithm coupled improved performance allows development new mathematical model solve simultaneously primary system redundancy design problem enabling system spare allocation problem,"['performance', 'based', 'logistics', 'pbl', 'emerging', 'preferred', 'logistic', 'support', 'strategy', 'within', 'public', 'sector', 'especially', 'pbl', 'strategy', 'customer', 'buys', 'performance', 'operational', 'availability', 'mission', 'readiness', 'operational', 'reliability', 'instead', 'contracting', 'specified', 'collection', 'resources', 'defining', 'underlying', 'support', 'infrastructure', 'literature', 'pbl', 'still', 'infancy', 'additional', 'required', 'optimize', 'logistic', 'resources', 'spare', 'parts', 'equipment', 'facilities', 'labor', 'etc', 'within', 'pbl', 'context', 'resource', 'decisions', 'need', 'focus', 'profit', 'margins', 'public', 'sector', 'contracts', 'migrate', 'traditional', 'cost', 'plus', 'fixed', 'fee', 'fixed', 'price', 'pbl', 'contracts', 'present', 'proposes', 'new', 'optimization', 'models', 'determine', 'configuration', 'operating', 'system', 'resource', 'quantities', 'location', 'comprising', 'support', 'infrastructure', 'maximizes', 'supplier', 'profit', 'first', 'two', 'models', 'examine', 'allocation', 'spare', 'resources', 'allocation', 'algorithm', 'defined', 'metric', 'theory', 'sherbrooke', 'muckstadt', 'graves', 'sherbrooke', 'sherbrooke', 'extended', 'make', 'relevant', 'pbl', 'domain', 'introducing', 'notion', 'profit', 'new', 'spares', 'algorithm', 'coupled', 'improved', 'performance', 'allows', 'development', 'new', 'mathematical', 'model', 'solve', 'simultaneously', 'primary', 'system', 'redundancy', 'design', 'problem', 'enabling', 'system', 'spares', 'allocation', 'problem']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
"Supplier quality assurance: Contract administration quality assurance program for ship repair, overhaul, and conversion","To maintain its fleets, the U.S. Navy has established Regional Maintenance Centers (RMC) which provide ""one-stop-shops"" for its maintenance needs. A significant percentage of the Navy's ship maintenance is accomplished by commercial shipyards. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) require the contractor to control quality and task the Navy with determining the type and amount of government quality assurance activity needed. The Navy's Joint Fleet Maintenance Manual (JFMM) defines the Navy's requirement for a government quality assurance program. Currently, each RMC has different processes and methods of implementing its quality activity. Thus the purpose of this project is to explore the regulations associated with government oversight of contracted ship repair and develop a written quality process which will satisfy the requirements of both the JFMM and FAR. The results of this project will be initially implemented at the Northwest Regional Maintenance Center with recommendations for further use at other RMCs.",304363901,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Johnson, David",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2008, Social sciences, 978-0-549-97703-2,,, English, English,,,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/supplier-quality-assurance-contract/docview/304363901/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Supplier+quality+assurance%3A+Contract+administration+quality+assurance+program+for+ship+repair%2C+overhaul%2C+and+conversion&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+David&amp;isbn=978-0-549-97703-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",maintain fleet navy established regional maintenance center rmc provide maintenance need significant percentage navy ship maintenance accomplished commercial shipyard federal acquisition regulation far require contractor control quality task navy determining type amount government quality assurance activity needed navy joint fleet maintenance manual jfmm defines navy requirement government quality assurance program currently rmc different process method implementing quality activity thus purpose project explore regulation associated government oversight contracted ship repair develop written quality process satisfy requirement jfmm far result project initially implemented northwest regional maintenance center recommendation use rmcs,"['maintain', 'fleets', 'navy', 'established', 'regional', 'maintenance', 'centers', 'rmc', 'provide', 'maintenance', 'needs', 'significant', 'percentage', 'navy', 'ship', 'maintenance', 'accomplished', 'commercial', 'shipyards', 'federal', 'acquisition', 'regulations', 'far', 'require', 'contractor', 'control', 'quality', 'task', 'navy', 'determining', 'type', 'amount', 'government', 'quality', 'assurance', 'activity', 'needed', 'navy', 'joint', 'fleet', 'maintenance', 'manual', 'jfmm', 'defines', 'navy', 'requirement', 'government', 'quality', 'assurance', 'program', 'currently', 'rmc', 'different', 'processes', 'methods', 'implementing', 'quality', 'activity', 'thus', 'purpose', 'project', 'explore', 'regulations', 'associated', 'government', 'oversight', 'contracted', 'ship', 'repair', 'develop', 'written', 'quality', 'process', 'satisfy', 'requirements', 'jfmm', 'far', 'results', 'project', 'initially', 'implemented', 'northwest', 'regional', 'maintenance', 'center', 'recommendations', 'use', 'rmcs']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
A grounded theory of U.S. Army installation realignment and closure leadership characteristics,"This grounded-theory study explored the Army leadership characteristics that supported successful installation realignments and closures overseas. Transcribed data from 28 leader and 8 subordinate and community member interviews, and historical artifacts relating to the period 2005 through 2007 were coded using a qualitative data analysis software program. Common themes that emerged from the data findings included (a) gaps between U.S.-based and Germany-based realignment and closure initiatives, (b) communication, (c) relationships, (d) supporting soldiers and families during war, and (e) taking care of people. The research findings indicate the core phenomenon of leadership characteristics that supported a successful installation realignment and closure process centers on goal determination. The causal conditions focused on (a) goal determination, (b) customer needs, (c) knowledge management, and (d) uncertainty. The research indicates the importance of flexible, adaptive, and innovative leadership, which represents the intervening variable to leader’s success in realigning and closing U.S. Army installations.",304330131,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Murray, Theresa Marie",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2008," Social sciences , Army , Army strategy , Base closure , Department of Defense , Grounded theory , Installation realignment , Leader characteristics , Leadership , United States Army", 978-0-549-79751-7,,, English, English,,,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/grounded-theory-u-s-army-installation-realignment/docview/304330131/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+grounded+theory+of+U.S.+Army+installation+realignment+and+closure+leadership+characteristics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Murray%2C+Theresa+Marie&amp;isbn=978-0-549-79751-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",explored army leadership characteristic supported successful installation realignments closure overseas transcribed leader subordinate community member interview historical artifact relating period coded using qualitative software program common theme emerged finding included gap realignment closure initiative communication relationship supporting soldier family war taking care people finding indicate core phenomenon leadership characteristic supported successful installation realignment closure process center goal determination causal condition focused goal determination customer need knowledge management uncertainty indicates importance flexible adaptive innovative leadership represents intervening variable leader success realigning closing army installation,"['explored', 'army', 'leadership', 'characteristics', 'supported', 'successful', 'installation', 'realignments', 'closures', 'overseas', 'transcribed', 'data', 'leader', 'subordinate', 'community', 'member', 'interviews', 'historical', 'artifacts', 'relating', 'period', 'coded', 'using', 'qualitative', 'data', 'software', 'program', 'common', 'themes', 'emerged', 'data', 'findings', 'included', 'gaps', 'realignment', 'closure', 'initiatives', 'communication', 'relationships', 'supporting', 'soldiers', 'families', 'war', 'taking', 'care', 'people', 'findings', 'indicate', 'core', 'phenomenon', 'leadership', 'characteristics', 'supported', 'successful', 'installation', 'realignment', 'closure', 'process', 'centers', 'goal', 'determination', 'causal', 'conditions', 'focused', 'goal', 'determination', 'customer', 'needs', 'knowledge', 'management', 'uncertainty', 'indicates', 'importance', 'flexible', 'adaptive', 'innovative', 'leadership', 'represents', 'intervening', 'variable', 'leader', 'success', 'realigning', 'closing', 'army', 'installations']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
The impact of help center workforce competency on service effectiveness: The National Systems for Geospatial -Intelligence (NSG) case study,"The National Systems for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) is a large, complex, information technology (IT) enterprise offering 300 geospatial information services supported by approximately 650 servers and 10 petabytes of storage of critical geospatial information. The NSG supplies geospatial information to 25 military commands and intelligence community agencies. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) established an enterprise service center (ESC) in May 2006 to centrally manage and provide NGA stakeholders with a single access point to NSG IT services. Recent investments to improve NGA ESC effectiveness include outsourcing IT service with defined service-level agreements, developing and implementing IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)-based processes with process-driven metrics, and integrating process-enhancing technology tools. NGA's intent in making these investments was to improve service quality, reduce costs, and improve response time. The problem investigated was that the NSG ESC workforce was not achieving its overall performance and effectiveness goals in terms of incident resolution rate. Based on findings from this investigation, the author determined how workforce competency affects service effectiveness. In this investigation, competency includes an individual's skills; experiences; and knowledge of processes, procedures, and tools. Tools include software that enables an individual to assign, monitor, and close an incident and, in turn, facilitates system administration actions, enterprise performance monitoring, and incident resolution trend analysis. The author conducted a case study of the NGA ESC to obtain a holistic understanding of ESC workforce competencies as applied to the incident management process. The understanding of workforce competency was accomplished through interviews, archival data review, and observations. The results of this study indicate that an individual's competence can directly affect the individual's service support effectiveness. The author concluded that in a structured, closely monitored, and well-managed ESC, increasing IT service management (ITSM) worker competence increased incident management service effectiveness. The results of this research also supported the position of the Office of Government Commerce, an international standards organization, that day-to-day operational performance of information management processes must be monitored, controlled, and managed. The research also showed that regardless of ESC worker competence in ITSM, a poorly managed ESC limits service effectiveness.",194026317,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Carbonell, Ann M.",,, Database

An extension and application of systems engineering tools to the development of a formal method for CAIV implementation,"Dr. Paul Kaminski (1995), then Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, among others, saw Target Costing, which U.S. aerospace firms had successfully used to make their products more competitive, as a way out of the dilemma of increasing system costs and decreasing availability of new system development funds for the Department of Defense, with affordability of new systems replacing price. Thus was born CAIV, Cost as an Independent Variable. Its key elements were limiting the number of Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), developing early aggressive cost thresholds for systems, and trading off system cost for schedule and performance. Significant success has been achieved in implementing the contract management aspects of CAIV, by creating Integrated Product Teams to increase communication between users, acquirers and developers, in establishing aggressive system cost goals, and using contractor performance incentives to reduce cost. Many researchers have attempted to create a process for trade space development (Graham 1999; Chollar and Peplinski 1999; Malone 2003; Schroder 2005), but a simple straightforward process has not emerged from these efforts. This dissertation develops a formal method for exploring the trade space that ensures that the voice of the customer is included, makes effective use of existing cost databases and parametric estimating systems, uses readily available, reasonable cost optimizing tools and produces a representation that allows viewing all the Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) in a easy to understand representation that considers their interactions. A process for CAIV trade space is developed, and demonstrated using parametric estimating equations directly and as quadratic meta-models. The process is used to create trade space representations both from a NASA dataset of space projects, and from NASA/Air Force NAFCOM cost estimating system data. Examples of how this may be used by a decision-maker are given. The process developed provides an interface for existing cost databases, estimating spreadsheets, and other parametric estimating tools. It uses EXCEL™ and Visual Basic for Applications™ (VBA), commonly available Microsoft Office™ tools to perform the optimization and inexpensive software to plot two parameter optimum contour plots which allow a Program Manager to see how various KPPs affect total achievable system performance for a given cost. CAIV trade space implemented through such a process can be measurably managed and improved, increasing its capability maturity level, and hence its usefulness as a tool for the systems engineering practitioner.",193985469,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Krupa, Joseph",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,,

Defense Watch,"Getting Hyper. Aerojet says it has demonstrated its Advanced Combined Cycle Integrated Inlet (ACCII) in more than three weeks of wind tunnel tests. The inlet is designed for turbine-based combined- cycle propulsion systems that integrate gas-powered, low-speed turbine engines with supersonic combustion ramjets to enable an aircraft to take off from a runway like a traditional fixed-wing platform but then reach hypersonic speeds up to Mach 7 or more using conventional jet fuels. ""The ACCII inlet provides a true 'combined cycle' approach, allowing smooth transition from low- to high-speed operation through the mission, as if the aircraft had one engine system,"" says Dick Bregard, Aerojet's vice president of Defense Programs. The tests were performed at NASA's wind tunnel in Langley, Va., with the support of the Air Force Research Laboratory. ""We have obtained a wealth of data from this program that will help us confidently develop future combined-cycle propulsion applications for the DoD and NASA,"" says David Davis, chief engineer of Aerojet's inlet team. ...More For The Corps. ""Since then, we got supplemental funding in '07, really to ensure the Marine Corps got what they need. We really wanted to get the Marine Corps to an all ICAP III force as soon as possible,"" [Steve Kochman] says. ""So, we got another seven kits that are going on contract and will go out to the Marine Corps."" The Navy expects to receive additional funding in '08 for another 11 ICAP III kits on top of that, he adds. That will get the Marine Corps up to all of the Prowlers they need, as the Navy transfers its EA-6Bs to the Marine Corps, and the Marine Corps gets planes directly from Northrop Grumman and through the depot, Kochman explains. It's Official. The Navy, Friday, officially stood up its new PEO Land Systems (PEO LS) at Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Va. Delores Etter, ASN RDA, presided over the ribbon-cutting ceremony. PEO LS is the Marine Corps' first PEO and is comprised of eight weapons systems programs. PEO LS is a separate command, reporting directly to the ASN RDA, the Navy says. PEO LS manages a diverse program management portfolio consisting of the Marine Corps' largest ground modernization program, the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle; two command-and-control programs, Common Aviation Command and Control System and Ground-Air Task Oriented Radar; and ground programs such as the Logistics Vehicle System Replacement, Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement, Lightweight 155mm Towed Howitzer, Joint Light Tactical Vehicle and Light Armored Vehicle Marine Personnel Carrier. The PEO is Col. Bill Taylor. The monetary value of the PEO's programs across the Future Years Defense Program is about $6.5 billion, the Navy adds.",234080376,,,Trade Journals,,,," Aerojet , Lockheed Martin Corp , Boeing Co ,

Learning That Could Save Lives,"When the US entered into the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), part of the Department of the Army, faced two daunting tasks: to hire and develop more than 1,000 new scientists and engineers to replace employees eligible for retirement, and to develop new weaponry and technology to support American soldiers in an unconventional war. Employees new to ARDEC, regardless of the number of advanced degrees they hold, require significant education and training. It is critical that scientists and engineers understand the deadly environment in which their end users work --- and the ways in which military personnel use and adapt their weapons in the field. Six full-time and five part-time staff design and deliver human capital initiatives for ARDEC's 3,000 employees under the auspices of Armament University and more than 50 unit administrators who help with outreach, support, and instruction.

U.S. Department of Defense: David V. Pauling,"  [David V. Pauling]: At this point PDO is one of the goals of (DOD's) Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to improve governance and the decision process. It describes an initiative that is in its formative stages, not yet mature enough to take up to the Secretary for policy directive. Upon institutionalization, the PDO term could remain PDO, or it could become PBL-plus, or another moniker. We will work with teams of experts who have been involved in CPI, PBL and outcome-based initiatives to put together lessons learned and determine the right construct for a Defense-wide PDO approach. For now we are making a distinction between what has been the perception of PBL as primarily logistics-oriented, output-based components and subsystems activity and the next step, establishing a performance-based outcome culture across the Defense Department. Pauling: PBL plus PDO focuses on the outcome and that outcome should be readiness at best cost. Some PBLs in the past have focused on availability, or reduced cost, or reduced cycle time. Not many have focused on all four metrics -- availability, reliability, mean down-time and cost -- together. Everybody should be working to the same set of metrics. That is the whole intent of PDO. You have got to do them all together, not one or the other. We have had PBLs where we achieved tremendous availability or tremendous cost savings. But did we achieve the best availability at the best cost savings? Did we achieve too much availability, more availability than we actually needed to do our mission? Pauling: Even with component-by-component, you need to aggregate up to the effect on the availability of the end item. It might make more sense to have a platform PBL, depending on the way the system is designed and bought and contracted for initially. Or you could have industry focus on components or subsystems, go with PBL for those subsystems, but you will need to understand how subsystem outcomes affect total system outcome. You should not have a PBL with industry on a subsystem that you cannot connect to availability of the end item. In other words, you do not want to have a PBL for 200 radars if you only need 100 radars to ensure the aircraft has its needed availability. I think there were some good points made in the GAO report on subsystem PBLs we had at the time, and there are some areas that we can mature. That is why we say PDO, Performance Driven Outcome.",223707729,,,Trade Journals,,,, Department of Defense," Copyright © 2007 The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., All rights reserved. http://www.mcgraw-hill.com",,, News,, Mar 2007," David , Defense , Availability",,1086-0983,3.0, English, English,, 14, Washington,Mar 2007,Overhaul & Maintenance,2007,,13.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/u-s-department-defense-david-v-pauling/docview/223707729/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amilitary&amp;atitle=U.S.+Department+of+Defense%3A+David+V.+Pauling&amp;title=Overhaul+%26+Maintenance&amp;issn=10860983&amp;date=2007-03-01&amp;volume=13&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=14&amp;au=&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Overhaul+%26+Maintenance&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",david pauling point pdo one goal acquisition technology logistics improve governance decision process describes initiative formative stage yet mature enough take secretary policy directive upon institutionalization pdo term could remain pdo could become another moniker work team expert involved cpi pbl initiative put together lesson learned determine right construct pdo making distinction perception pbl primarily component subsystem activity next step establishing outcome culture across pauling pbl plus pdo focus outcome outcome readiness best cost pbls past focused availability reduced cost reduced cycle time many focused four metric availability reliability mean cost together everybody working set metric whole intent pdo got together one pbls achieved tremendous availability tremendous cost saving achieve best availability best cost saving achieve much availability availability actually needed mission pauling even need aggregate effect availability end item might make sense platform pbl depending way system designed bought contracted initially could industry focus component subsystem pbl subsystem need understand subsystem outcome affect total system outcome pbl industry subsystem connect availability end item word want pbl radar need radar ensure aircraft needed availability think good point made gao report subsystem pbls time area mature say pdo performance driven outcome,"['david', 'pauling', 'point', 'pdo', 'one', 'goals', 'acquisition', 'technology', 'logistics', 'improve', 'governance', 'decision', 'process', 'describes', 'initiative', 'formative', 'stages', 'yet', 'mature', 'enough', 'take', 'secretary', 'policy', 'directive', 'upon', 'institutionalization', 'pdo', 'term', 'could', 'remain', 'pdo', 'could', 'become', 'another', 'moniker', 'work', 'teams', 'experts', 'involved', 'cpi', 'pbl', 'initiatives', 'put', 'together', 'lessons', 'learned', 'determine', 'right', 'construct', 'pdo', 'making', 'distinction', 'perception', 'pbl', 'primarily', 'components', 'subsystems', 'activity', 'next', 'step', 'establishing', 'outcome', 'culture', 'across', 'pauling', 'pbl', 'plus', 'pdo', 'focuses', 'outcome', 'outcome', 'readiness', 'best', 'cost', 'pbls', 'past', 'focused', 'availability', 'reduced', 'cost', 'reduced', 'cycle', 'time', 'many', 'focused', 'four', 'metrics', 'availability', 'reliability', 'mean', 'cost', 'together', 'everybody', 'working', 'set', 'metrics', 'whole', 'intent', 'pdo', 'got', 'together', 'one', 'pbls', 'achieved', 'tremendous', 'availability', 'tremendous', 'cost', 'savings', 'achieve', 'best', 'availability', 'best', 'cost', 'savings', 'achieve', 'much', 'availability', 'availability', 'actually', 'needed', 'mission', 'pauling', 'even', 'need', 'aggregate', 'effect', 'availability', 'end', 'item', 'might', 'make', 'sense', 'platform', 'pbl', 'depending', 'way', 'system', 'designed', 'bought', 'contracted', 'initially', 'could', 'industry', 'focus', 'components', 'subsystems', 'pbl', 'subsystems', 'need', 'understand', 'subsystem', 'outcomes', 'affect', 'total', 'system', 'outcome', 'pbl', 'industry', 'subsystem', 'connect', 'availability', 'end', 'item', 'words', 'want', 'pbl', 'radars', 'need', 'radars', 'ensure', 'aircraft', 'needed', 'availability', 'think', 'good', 'points', 'made', 'gao', 'report', 'subsystem', 'pbls', 'time', 'areas', 'mature', 'say', 'pdo', 'performance', 'driven', 'outcome']",News,2,Process Improvement
Characterizing high-energy-density propellants for space propulsion applications,"There exists wide ranging research interest in high-energy-density matter (HEDM) propellants as a potential replacement for existing industry standard fuels for liquid rocket engines. The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, the U.S. Army Research Lab, the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, and the NASA Glenn Research Center each either recently concluded or currently has ongoing programs in the synthesis and development of these potential new propellants. In order to perform conceptual designs using these new propellants, most conceptual rocket engine powerhead design tools (e.g. NPSS, ROCETS, and REDTOP-2) require several thermophysical properties of a given propellant over a wide range of temperature and pressure. These properties include enthalpy, entropy, density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Very little thermophysical property data exists for most of these potential new HEDM propellants. Experimental testing of these properties is both expensive and time consuming and is impractical in a conceptual vehicle design environment. A new technique for determining these thermophysical properties of potential new rocket engine propellants is presented. The technique uses a combination of three different computational methods to determine these properties. Quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics are used to model new propellants at a molecular level in order to calculate density, enthalpy, and entropy. Additivity methods are used to calculate the kinematic viscosity and thermal conductivity of new propellants. This new technique is validated via a series of verification experiments of HEDM compounds. Results are provided for two HEDM propellants: quadricyclane and 2-azido-N,N-dimethylethanamine (DMAZ). In each case, the new technique does a better job than the best current computational methods at accurately matching the experimental data of the HEDM compounds of interest. A case study is provided to help quantify the vehicle level impacts of using HEDM propellants. The case study consists of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM). The results of this study show that the use of HEDM propellants instead of hypergolic propellants can lower the gross weight of the LSAM and may be an attractive alternative to the current baseline hypergolic propellant choice.",304874941,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Kokan, Timothy",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,

Leadership and safety climate in high -risk military organizations,"Preventable accidents and mishaps continue to degrade the readiness of U.S. military forces. In 2006, the National Safety Council reported an annual rate of over 30 accidental fatalities per 100,000 Department of Defense members and estimated that preventable injuries and illnesses cost the department approximately $21 billion per year. Reducing these occurrences was the policy mandate of the Secretary of Defense in 2003. He challenged the military service secretaries to reduce their mishap rates by 50 percent over a two-year period ending September 30, 2005. While each of the military services formulated its own compliance strategy, none of them met the reduction goal. In some cases, the mishap rate actually increased. The purpose of this dissertation is to evaluate the Department of the Navy's (DON) policy compliance strategy and to assess its shortcomings and areas for future improvements. The Navy focused their efforts on leadership-intervention best practices designed to elevate the safety climate in their high-risk units, primarily their aviation components. These units contribute almost 90 percent of the annual mishap cost due to preventable accidents. DON policy-makers theorized that certain leadership interventions would improve safety climate thereby reducing the likelihood that unit members would engage in unsafe behavior both on and off the job. This dissertation evaluates the validity of that general theory, and the appropriateness of the specific leadership interventions chosen, in two distinct data collection and analysis phases. In the first phase, statistical analysis is conducted on a safety-climate survey database maintained by the Naval Post-Graduate School containing 20,000 Navy and Marine Corps military survey respondents assigned to F/A-18 aircraft squadrons completed over the past 5 years. In Phase 2, Commander, Naval Air Forces Atlantic Fleet authorized climate research in four Navy F/A-18 squadrons located at Oceana Naval Air Station. Upon analysis, the intervention methods implemented in the Navy's mishap reduction strategy showed little correlation with safety climate improvement. Phase 2 analysis identified several organizational programs and specific leadership qualities that correlate with elevated safety climate and revealed a preliminary causal relationship between safety climate and safety performance.",304853228,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Adamshick, Mark H.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Leanness and agility in job shops: A framework for a survey instrument developed using the Delphi method,"Manufacturers are facing new challenges as competition has become global. Manufacturing companies are looking for strategies which would help them gain an edge over their competitors. In the United States, lean manufacturing and agile manufacturing have been gaining importance among industries. Agile manufacturing was developed when the United States Department of Defense (DOD) requested Iacocca Institute at Lehigh University to develop a manufacturing framework that could give US companies an edge over their worldwide competitors whereas lean manufacturing has its roots tied to the Toyota Production System (TPS). This raises the questions: what is the clear difference between the two and how different would it be when both strategies are applied to the manufacturing enterprise? And, what could be the indicators of both the strategies? Considering the different types of companies in the manufacturing spectrum, this study was focused on one segment of manufacturing known as job shops. The objective of this study was to develop a framework for a survey questionnaire to measure the leanness and agility of job shops. This study made use of the Delphi technique to obtain lean and agility indicators. Two different Delphi studies were conducted utilizing panels of lean and agile experts. The experts were dispersed geographically around the world including Israel, United Kingdom and United States. A framework for a questionnaire that could be utilized to measure agility and leanness of job shops was developed. The lean and agility indicators that resulted from the Delphi study were used for the framework. Based on the results of the Delphi studies the researcher deduced that leanness and agility are two different concepts addressing two different aspects of an organization, even though there is some overlap. They are not complementing, contradicting or competing strategies to each other; rather they should be co-existing strategies.",304851401,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Kuruppalil, Zaki",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2007," Social sciences , Agility , Job shops , Leanness , Manufacturing , Survey instrument", 978-0-549-28598-4,,, English, English,,,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/leanness-agility-job-shops-framework-survey/docview/304851401/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Leanness+and+agility+in+job+shops%3A+A+framework+for+a+survey+instrument+developed+using+the+Delphi+method&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kuruppalil%2C+Zaki&amp;isbn=978-0-549-28598-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,manufacturer facing new challenge competition become global manufacturing company looking strategy would help gain edge competitor united state lean manufacturing agile manufacturing gaining importance among industry agile manufacturing developed united state requested iacocca institute lehigh develop manufacturing framework could give company edge worldwide competitor whereas lean manufacturing root tied toyota production system tps raise question clear difference two different would strategy applied manufacturing enterprise could indicator strategy considering different type company manufacturing spectrum focused one segment manufacturing known job shop objective develop framework survey questionnaire measure leanness agility job shop made use delphi technique obtain lean agility indicator two different delphi study conducted utilizing panel lean agile expert expert dispersed geographically around world including israel united kingdom united state framework questionnaire could utilized measure agility leanness job shop developed lean agility indicator resulted delphi used framework based result delphi study researcher deduced leanness agility two different concept addressing two different aspect organization even though overlap complementing contradicting competing strategy rather strategy,"['manufacturers', 'facing', 'new', 'challenges', 'competition', 'become', 'global', 'manufacturing', 'companies', 'looking', 'strategies', 'would', 'help', 'gain', 'edge', 'competitors', 'united', 'states', 'lean', 'manufacturing', 'agile', 'manufacturing', 'gaining', 'importance', 'among', 'industries', 'agile', 'manufacturing', 'developed', 'united', 'states', 'requested', 'iacocca', 'institute', 'lehigh', 'university', 'develop', 'manufacturing', 'framework', 'could', 'give', 'companies', 'edge', 'worldwide', 'competitors', 'whereas', 'lean', 'manufacturing', 'roots', 'tied', 'toyota', 'production', 'system', 'tps', 'raises', 'questions', 'clear', 'difference', 'two', 'different', 'would', 'strategies', 'applied', 'manufacturing', 'enterprise', 'could', 'indicators', 'strategies', 'considering', 'different', 'types', 'companies', 'manufacturing', 'spectrum', 'focused', 'one', 'segment', 'manufacturing', 'known', 'job', 'shops', 'objective', 'develop', 'framework', 'survey', 'questionnaire', 'measure', 'leanness', 'agility', 'job', 'shops', 'made', 'use', 'delphi', 'technique', 'obtain', 'lean', 'agility', 'indicators', 'two', 'different', 'delphi', 'studies', 'conducted', 'utilizing', 'panels', 'lean', 'agile', 'experts', 'experts', 'dispersed', 'geographically', 'around', 'world', 'including', 'israel', 'united', 'kingdom', 'united', 'states', 'framework', 'questionnaire', 'could', 'utilized', 'measure', 'agility', 'leanness', 'job', 'shops', 'developed', 'lean', 'agility', 'indicators', 'resulted', 'delphi', 'used', 'framework', 'based', 'results', 'delphi', 'studies', 'researcher', 'deduced', 'leanness', 'agility', 'two', 'different', 'concepts', 'addressing', 'two', 'different', 'aspects', 'organization', 'even', 'though', 'overlap', 'complementing', 'contradicting', 'competing', 'strategies', 'rather', 'strategies']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
Does money really matter? The effects of organizational finances on quality of health care,"This dissertation is divided into three separate but related studies pertaining to organizational finances and quality of health care. The first study identifies the pertinent empirical literature on the topic of interest and provides a unifying conceptual framework with reference to each study’s focus and quality measures. The second study investigates the finance-quality relationship within Department of Defense hospitals. The third and final study follows a similar investigative approach with federally funded community health centers serving as the unit of analysis. The purpose of the first study was to uncover the existing empirical literature as it pertains to the relationships between healthcare organizational finances and quality of care. Based on these findings I was able to develop the bases for predictions about how health care organization finances would affect quality within other organizational contexts. Eventually only 16 empirically rigorous studies on this topic were drawn from the available literature between 1980 and 2005. Collectively, these articles indicate that organizational expenses, net margins, and asset and liability management all affect healthcare outcome quality. There is less evidence about how organizational finance factors affect structural or process quality. The purpose of the second study was to empirically test the association between financial resources and health care quality in Department of Defense hospitals. Financial and organizational data from the 2003 Health Care Survey of Defense Department Beneficiaries (HCSDB) and 1999-2003 data from the Department of Defense Medical Expense Performance Reporting System (MEPRS) are used. I employ a measure of military treatment facility fiscal margin to predict seven Consumer Assessment of Health Plan Satisfaction (CAHPS) quality dimensions. Ordinary least squares regression analysis and multilevel modeling are the primary statistical methods. Results indicate a significant and positive association between organizational finances and quality outcomes. This indicates that organizations with more financial flexibility may be more adept at meeting or exceeding patient care expectations. The purpose of the third study was to determine the nature of the finance-quality association within the ambulatory care context. The number of federally funded health centers has increased significantly due to a major Bush administration expansion initiative. As the number of health centers has increased, however, questions remain about financial capacity to provide quality care. In this study, I hypothesize that health centers with greater fiscal margins will provide preventive and primary care to a greater proportion of their patients. Seven years (1998-2004) of data are used from the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Uniform Data System, to test the association between organization finances and four process quality dependent variables, inclusive of two preventive care measures (e.g., percent of patients receiving PAP smears and percent under routine health supervision) and two well child/mother measures (e.g., % receiving first trimester care and % receiving post partum care). Multilevel modeling is the primary statistical method. Results indicate a significant and positive cross sectional association between organizational financial margins and percentages of patients receiving preventive health care. Findings are less supportive or negatively oriented when primary care is the dependent variable of interest. Based on our findings, health center net revenue may be responsible for initial preventative care improvements, but appears less supportive of primary care service enhancement. Surprisingly, however, we also find the preventative care advantages gained from higher comparative net revenues to diminish while primary care (i.e., post partum care) services are enhanced over time. In sum, this series of investigations addresses a significant gap in the health services literature pertaining to organizational financing and health care quality for three reasons. First, this research is the first known application of multi-level modeling in research applied to the finance-quality relationship, providing perspective on how organizational finances influence health care quality over time. Second, Department of Defense hospitals and federally funded community health centers are under studied organizations that comprise essential portions of the nation’s health care safety net. Third, with the recognized shortcomings in health care quality on a national scale and U.S. health care costs exceeding $1.7 trillion each year—and growing—there has never been a more appropriate time to investigate the finance-quality relationship (CMS, 2006; AHA, 2006).",304833780,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Beauvais, Bradley Michael",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim

A qualitative case study of employee effectiveness using information technology in federal law enforcement agencies,"The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore leaders' perceptions of the effectiveness of employees who employ information technology (IT) to complete tasks by conducting in-depth interviews of 20 upper-level leaders in federal law enforcement agencies. The chosen leaders were personnel from the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigations Division, and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service. Findings of the study reflect ways that upper-level leaders can employ IT more effectively to empower personnel in federal law enforcement agencies. The results could reduce wasted taxpayer monies that purchase and support federal law enforcement IT and increase employee empowerment using IT to protect the United States. Twenty-three themes emerged in the qualitative analyses of the study. Leaders felt that, if properly used, IT could add to employee effectiveness to catch the highest-level criminal. Leaders in federal law enforcement agencies perceived employees' failure to use IT effectively as the employees' fault, a result of inadequate employee training, and a result of system technical problems. Results found that some leaders perceived that any IT failure is not an employee's problem but a problem with leadership. Leaders reported e-mail is the most effective form of IT when dealing with employees, the computer is not the most effective form of IT when dealing with employees, computer products are most effective when dealing with employees, and systems used to share information with other federal law enforcement agencies. Leaders reported having a positive perception of IT and employee effectiveness, computers are the most effective form of IT, and e-mail is used to share information with other federal agencies.",304733035,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Wilson, Freddy B.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2007," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Education , Employee effectiveness , Empowerment , Federal law enforcement , Homeland Security , Information sharing , Information technology , Information technology (IT) , Law enforcement", 978-0-549-76491-5,,, English, English,,,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/qualitative-case-study-employee-effectiveness/docview/304733035/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+qualitative+case+study+of+employee+effectiveness+using+information+technology+in+federal+law+enforcement+agencies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wilson%2C+Freddy+B.&amp;isbn=978-0-549-76491-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,purpose qualitative case explore leader perception effectiveness employee employ information technology complete task conducting interview leader federal law enforcement agency chosen leader personnel air force office special investigation naval criminal investigative service army criminal investigation division criminal investigative service finding reflect way leader employ effectively empower personnel federal law enforcement agency result could reduce wasted taxpayer monies purchase support federal law enforcement increase employee empowerment using protect united state theme emerged qualitative analysis leader felt properly used could add employee effectiveness catch criminal leader federal law enforcement agency perceived employee failure use effectively employee fault inadequate employee training system technical problem result found leader perceived failure employee problem problem leadership leader reported effective form dealing employee computer effective form dealing employee computer product effective dealing employee system used share information federal law enforcement agency leader reported positive perception employee effectiveness computer effective form used share information federal agency,"['purpose', 'qualitative', 'case', 'explore', 'leaders', 'perceptions', 'effectiveness', 'employees', 'employ', 'information', 'technology', 'complete', 'tasks', 'conducting', 'interviews', 'leaders', 'federal', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agencies', 'chosen', 'leaders', 'personnel', 'air', 'force', 'office', 'special', 'investigations', 'naval', 'criminal', 'investigative', 'service', 'army', 'criminal', 'investigations', 'division', 'criminal', 'investigative', 'service', 'findings', 'reflect', 'ways', 'leaders', 'employ', 'effectively', 'empower', 'personnel', 'federal', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agencies', 'results', 'could', 'reduce', 'wasted', 'taxpayer', 'monies', 'purchase', 'support', 'federal', 'law', 'enforcement', 'increase', 'employee', 'empowerment', 'using', 'protect', 'united', 'states', 'themes', 'emerged', 'qualitative', 'analyses', 'leaders', 'felt', 'properly', 'used', 'could', 'add', 'employee', 'effectiveness', 'catch', 'criminal', 'leaders', 'federal', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agencies', 'perceived', 'employees', 'failure', 'use', 'effectively', 'employees', 'fault', 'result', 'inadequate', 'employee', 'training', 'result', 'system', 'technical', 'problems', 'results', 'found', 'leaders', 'perceived', 'failure', 'employee', 'problem', 'problem', 'leadership', 'leaders', 'reported', 'effective', 'form', 'dealing', 'employees', 'computer', 'effective', 'form', 'dealing', 'employees', 'computer', 'products', 'effective', 'dealing', 'employees', 'systems', 'used', 'share', 'information', 'federal', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agencies', 'leaders', 'reported', 'positive', 'perception', 'employee', 'effectiveness', 'computers', 'effective', 'form', 'used', 'share', 'information', 'federal', 'agencies']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership

Modernizing Logistics Business Systems - Achieving World Class Performance,"  Of interest are the following specific initiatives: * Outsourcing of commercially available consumables and reliance on existing commercial supply chains for items such as food, fuel, shop materials and medical supplies. * Use of corporate contracts for weapon system unique consumable items. * Purchase of weapon system readiness or equipment availability as a performance outcome from equipment manufacturers (rather than purchase of spare parts on an as needed basis). * Use of commercial partnering and continuous process improvement techniques that enhance operations throughout the DoD logistics enterprise and reduce costs at maintenance facilities. * Designation of USTRANSCOM as the DoD DPO to integrate the end-to-end distribution process. * Evolution of DLA - forward to position materials closer to the point of need and reduce response times and costs. * Application of active and passive radio frequency identification and unique item identification to enhance end-to-end asset visibility. * Evolution of the joint deployment and distribution enterprise to integrate and coordinate joint theater logistics. Some noteworthy results include: * DLA has improved material availability to almost 100% and reduced lead-times to 24-48 hours using commercial supply chains for food, medical items and shop materials. * Military Services have dramatically improved weapon system availability, reduced lead-times from 50 days to 4 days and dramatically reduced costs through performance based logistics contracts. * The DoD has reduced average customer wait time from 24 days to 16 days through better integration of their end-to-end distribution process and improved asset visibility.",195308028,,,Trade Journals,,"Kratz, Louis A", LGSCAN,, Copyright Society of Logistics Engineers Jan-Mar 2007,,, Feature,, Jan-Mar 2007," Military logistics , Military service , Logistics , Business",,0024-5852,1.0, English, English,, 41-44, Huntsville,Jan-Mar 2007,Logistics Spectrum,2007,,41.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/modernizing-logistics-business-systems-achieving/docview/195308028/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amilitary&amp;atitle=Modernizing+Logistics+Business+Systems+-+Achieving+World+Class+Performance&amp;title=Logistics+Spectrum&amp;issn=00245852&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=41&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=41&amp;au=Kratz%2C+Louis+A&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Logistics+Spectrum&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",interest following specific initiative outsourcing commercially available consumables reliance existing commercial supply chain item food fuel shop material medical supply use corporate contract weapon system unique consumable item purchase weapon system readiness equipment availability performance outcome equipment manufacturer rather purchase spare part needed basis use commercial partnering continuous process improvement technique enhance operation throughout logistics enterprise reduce cost maintenance facility designation ustranscom dpo integrate distribution process evolution dla forward position material closer point need reduce response time cost application active passive radio frequency identification unique item identification enhance asset visibility evolution joint deployment distribution enterprise integrate coordinate joint theater logistics noteworthy result include dla improved material availability almost reduced hour using commercial supply chain food medical item shop material service dramatically improved weapon system availability reduced day day dramatically reduced cost performance based logistics contract reduced average customer wait time day day better integration distribution process improved asset visibility,"['interest', 'following', 'specific', 'initiatives', 'outsourcing', 'commercially', 'available', 'consumables', 'reliance', 'existing', 'commercial', 'supply', 'chains', 'items', 'food', 'fuel', 'shop', 'materials', 'medical', 'supplies', 'use', 'corporate', 'contracts', 'weapon', 'system', 'unique', 'consumable', 'items', 'purchase', 'weapon', 'system', 'readiness', 'equipment', 'availability', 'performance', 'outcome', 'equipment', 'manufacturers', 'rather', 'purchase', 'spare', 'parts', 'needed', 'basis', 'use', 'commercial', 'partnering', 'continuous', 'process', 'improvement', 'techniques', 'enhance', 'operations', 'throughout', 'logistics', 'enterprise', 'reduce', 'costs', 'maintenance', 'facilities', 'designation', 'ustranscom', 'dpo', 'integrate', 'distribution', 'process', 'evolution', 'dla', 'forward', 'position', 'materials', 'closer', 'point', 'need', 'reduce', 'response', 'times', 'costs', 'application', 'active', 'passive', 'radio', 'frequency', 'identification', 'unique', 'item', 'identification', 'enhance', 'asset', 'visibility', 'evolution', 'joint', 'deployment', 'distribution', 'enterprise', 'integrate', 'coordinate', 'joint', 'theater', 'logistics', 'noteworthy', 'results', 'include', 'dla', 'improved', 'material', 'availability', 'almost', 'reduced', 'hours', 'using', 'commercial', 'supply', 'chains', 'food', 'medical', 'items', 'shop', 'materials', 'services', 'dramatically', 'improved', 'weapon', 'system', 'availability', 'reduced', 'days', 'days', 'dramatically', 'reduced', 'costs', 'performance', 'based', 'logistics', 'contracts', 'reduced', 'average', 'customer', 'wait', 'time', 'days', 'days', 'better', 'integration', 'distribution', 'process', 'improved', 'asset', 'visibility']",Feature,2,Process Improvement

"ADDITION OF MANEUVER TRAINING LAND AT FORT IRWIN, SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA (FINAL SUPPLEMENT TO THE DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT OF DECEMBER 1996). TO THE CALIFORNIA DESERT CONSERVATION AREA PLAN. [Part 11 of 11]","PURPOSE: The acquisition of approximately 150,510 acres of public lands to support the training mission of the U.S. Army National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, located in southeast California, is proposed. Fort Irwin encompasses approximately 642,000 acres of land near the City of Barstow. The NTC is a combat training center for thee Army, which trains 10 armored brigades each year in exercises known as rotations. Rotations last from 28 to 35 days and involve approximately 9,000 soldiers and Army civilians. The training exercises are designed to provide shoulders with the experience needed to excel at their missions. Advancements in military technology and the need to address those advancements are a driving factor for the proposed expansion of the fort. Larger ranges are needed to test and train personnel in the use of new weapon systems and strategies. It has been determined that approximately 624,470 acres of net maneuver area are required to meet Army training needs. The current maneuver area on Fort Irwin covers 350,300 acres, leaving a shortfall of 274,170 acres. For the purposes of the present proposal, the study area lies predominantly to the south, east, and west of the fort. The area also includes two parcels of land on Fort Irwin collectively known as the UTM 90 area; these areas generally lie south of the Universal Traverse Mercator 90 gridline but also include an additional parcel of land to the northwest of that coordinate. These lands were formerly used for heavy mechanized training, but were placed off-limits in 1991 due to the presence of the desert tortoise, a federally protected endangered species. This final supplement to the draft EIS of December 1996 addressing the Army's land acquisition project for the National Training Center at Fort Irwin fully replaces the 1996 EIS. All alternatives considered in the earlier EIS are no longer under consideration. Six alternatives, including a No Action Alternative (Alternative VI), are considered in this supplement. The preferred alternative (Alternative I) would result in the acquisition of 150,510 acres. This would provide for the reintroduction of the UTM 90 area into mechanized training use. the eastern portion of this alternative includes the southern portion of the Avawatz Mountains and runs parallel, northeast to southwest, along the utilities rights-of-way of the Bureau of Land Management's Utility Planning Corridor D. The southern portion of the area consists of the UTM 90 area. The western portion of the area includes a segment of the Paradise Mountains and two of the Superior lakes. Under Alternative I, a three-mile transit route through the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goldstone Complex would be improve for use by Fort Irwin personnel to allow access to Superior Valley. POSITIVE IMPACTS: The acquisition of additional maneuverable land would provide an expanded battle-space environment to enable the NTC to conduct its mission of training brigade-sized units in accordance with present and future joint and combined-arms operations doctrines. NEGATIVE IMPACTS: Any ecological community occurring in terrain with a slope of less than 20 percent would be adversely affected. Soil and vegetation would be disturbed due to intensive use of tracked and wheeled vehicles, landing pads and similar facilities, and trenching for tank and gun emplacement. the soils on up to 141,890 acres of land would be adversely affected due to the crushing of rock outcrops, the disturbance of desert pavement, the compaction of upper soil layers, and wind and water erosion. There would be significant large-scale losses of vegetation in concentrated activity areas that are slow to recover. Large areas of Mojave creosote scrub would be lost, as would habitat for a population of desert tortoise and for Lane Mountain milk vetch, a federally protected plant species. Numerous archaeological and paleontological sites could be disturbed during training maneuvers. Maneuvers would require elimination of public access to the area for recreation and other purposes, including patent mining. One residence would be displace, and maneuvers could conflict with the mission of the Goldstone Complex.` LEGAL MANDATES: Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702 et seq.), National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.), Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 (P.L. 106-554), Public Law 106-554, and Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601).

"Army Aviation becomes an essential arm: From the Howze Board to the modular force, 1962–2004","The author contends that Army Aviation evolved from an auxiliary in the early 1960s into an essential support branch providing firepower and mobility for the U.S. Army by 2004 as a result of a combination of internal cultural and external strategic factors. This study will examine the interrelated organizational, doctrinal, and technological evolution of U.S. Army Aviation within the context of U.S. national strategy, from its infancy in the early 1960s to its role in the war on terrorism by 2004: Thanks to the conceptual impetus propounded by the 1962 Howze Board, Army Aviation transcended its minor ancillary role in World War II with small fixed-wing aircraft and became a vital element of the U.S. Army in Vietnam. In the latter conflict, Army Aviation used rotary-wing helicopters to provide the mobility and firepower of cavalry despite significant inter-service misunderstandings. After Vietnam, the promise of technologically-complex attack helicopters fostered the creation of Army Aviation as a separate branch in 1983. Internal Army policies, inter-service doctrinal challenges, and inter-branch competition for limited funding resulted in Army Aviation not realizing its full potential in the Persian Gulf War, its estrangement from the other combat arms, and its 1999 failure as Task Force Hawk in Kosovo. During combat in Afghanistan and Iraq following September 2001, Army Aviation once again has contributed vital combat capabilities and has been reshaped as part of the Army's Modular Force Initiative to continue providing essential support to the Army's other combat branches.",304985791,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Bonin, John A.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2006," Social sciences , Afghanistan , Army Aviation , Howze Board , Iraq , Modular force , United States Army , Vietnam", 978-0-542-87035-4,,, English, English,,,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/army-aviation-becomes-essential-arm-howze-board/docview/304985791/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Army+Aviation+becomes+an+essential+arm%3A+From+the+Howze+Board+to+the+modular+force%2C+1962%E2%80%932004&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bonin%2C+John+A.&amp;isbn=978-0-542-87035-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",author contends army aviation evolved auxiliary early essential support branch providing firepower mobility army combination internal cultural external strategic factor examine interrelated organizational doctrinal technological evolution army aviation within context national strategy infancy early role war terrorism thanks conceptual impetus propounded howze board army aviation transcended minor ancillary role world war small aircraft became vital element army vietnam latter conflict army aviation used helicopter provide mobility firepower cavalry despite significant misunderstanding vietnam promise attack helicopter fostered creation army aviation separate branch internal army policy doctrinal challenge competition limited funding resulted army aviation realizing full potential persian gulf war estrangement combat arm failure task force hawk kosovo combat afghanistan iraq following september army aviation contributed vital combat capability reshaped part army modular force initiative continue providing essential support army combat branch,"['author', 'contends', 'army', 'aviation', 'evolved', 'auxiliary', 'early', 'essential', 'support', 'branch', 'providing', 'firepower', 'mobility', 'army', 'result', 'combination', 'internal', 'cultural', 'external', 'strategic', 'factors', 'examine', 'interrelated', 'organizational', 'doctrinal', 'technological', 'evolution', 'army', 'aviation', 'within', 'context', 'national', 'strategy', 'infancy', 'early', 'role', 'war', 'terrorism', 'thanks', 'conceptual', 'impetus', 'propounded', 'howze', 'board', 'army', 'aviation', 'transcended', 'minor', 'ancillary', 'role', 'world', 'war', 'small', 'aircraft', 'became', 'vital', 'element', 'army', 'vietnam', 'latter', 'conflict', 'army', 'aviation', 'used', 'helicopters', 'provide', 'mobility', 'firepower', 'cavalry', 'despite', 'significant', 'misunderstandings', 'vietnam', 'promise', 'attack', 'helicopters', 'fostered', 'creation', 'army', 'aviation', 'separate', 'branch', 'internal', 'army', 'policies', 'doctrinal', 'challenges', 'competition', 'limited', 'funding', 'resulted', 'army', 'aviation', 'realizing', 'full', 'potential', 'persian', 'gulf', 'war', 'estrangement', 'combat', 'arms', 'failure', 'task', 'force', 'hawk', 'kosovo', 'combat', 'afghanistan', 'iraq', 'following', 'september', 'army', 'aviation', 'contributed', 'vital', 'combat', 'capabilities', 'reshaped', 'part', 'army', 'modular', 'force', 'initiative', 'continue', 'providing', 'essential', 'support', 'army', 'combat', 'branches']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Strategic communications in the systems age: A unified theory in complex adaptive information environments,"This paper seeks to develop a unified theory for strategic communication within the Department of Defense and explores the complex interrelationships of audiences in the systems age, as well as how the creation of a globalized information environment makes strategic communications an imperative for the U.S. government. The problem is that governmental strategic communications may be too complex for traditional bureaucratic organizations, and so it may be necessary to shed a bureaucratic approach in favor of an effect-based, audience-oriented process. The objective of this research and modified strategic communications methodology is to offer a compelling argument for organizational coordination in communications. This approach focuses upon the unique behavior and role of social perception in four major audience groups, and attempts to harmonize organizational communications through an appreciation of global audience complexities in systems age.",304971342,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"King, Daniel J.

Optimization for finite element modeling of electronic components under dynamic loading,"Usage of electronic components in the U.S. ARMY applications is becoming more challenging due to their usage in harsh environments. Experimental verification of these components is expensive and it can yield information about specific locations only. This research outlines the finite element modeling methodology for these electronic components that are subjected to high acceleration loads that occur over extremely short time such as impact, gun firing and blast events. Due to their miniature size these finite element models are computationally expensive. An optimization engine was presented to have an efficient analysis procedure that provides a combination of accuracy, computational speed and modeling simplicity. This research also involves experimental testing of the electronic components mounted on the circuit boards. Testing was conducted at different strain levels in order to study the behavior of boards. Finite element models were developed for these tests and compared with experimental results.",304964031,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Sridharala, Srujanbabu",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2006," Applied sciences , Dynamic loading , Electronic components", 978-1-109-94395-5,,, English, English,,,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/optimization-finite-element-modeling-electronic/docview/304964031/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Optimization+for+finite+element+modeling+of+electronic+components+under+dynamic+loading&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sridharala%2C+Srujanbabu&amp;isbn=978-1-109-94395-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,usage electronic component army application becoming challenging due usage harsh environment experimental verification component expensive yield information specific location outline finite element modeling electronic component subjected high acceleration load occur extremely short time impact gun firing blast event due miniature size finite element model computationally expensive optimization engine presented efficient procedure provides combination accuracy computational speed modeling simplicity also involves experimental testing electronic component mounted circuit board testing conducted different strain level order behavior board finite element model developed test compared experimental result,"['usage', 'electronic', 'components', 'army', 'applications', 'becoming', 'challenging', 'due', 'usage', 'harsh', 'environments', 'experimental', 'verification', 'components', 'expensive', 'yield', 'information', 'specific', 'locations', 'outlines', 'finite', 'element', 'modeling', 'electronic', 'components', 'subjected', 'high', 'acceleration', 'loads', 'occur', 'extremely', 'short', 'time', 'impact', 'gun', 'firing', 'blast', 'events', 'due', 'miniature', 'size', 'finite', 'element', 'models', 'computationally', 'expensive', 'optimization', 'engine', 'presented', 'efficient', 'procedure', 'provides', 'combination', 'accuracy', 'computational', 'speed', 'modeling', 'simplicity', 'also', 'involves', 'experimental', 'testing', 'electronic', 'components', 'mounted', 'circuit', 'boards', 'testing', 'conducted', 'different', 'strain', 'levels', 'order', 'behavior', 'boards', 'finite', 'element', 'models', 'developed', 'tests', 'compared', 'experimental', 'results']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
The human element of organizational transformation: A phenomenographic study of how internal stakeholders in Federal defense organizations experience and make sense of planned organizational change,"Half the efforts to transform organizations fail to achieve the desired results (Cameron, 1997). In 2005, the Federal government expected to spend billions of dollars on an expensive and risky undertaking---the transformation of the Department of Defense (DoD). This study refers to that transformation as planned organizational change and explores the experiences of two groups of stakeholders: planners/implementers and contributors/recipients. Three concepts---stakeholder, planned change, and sensemaking---provide the theoretical framework. The research question is: How do internal stakeholders in Federal defense organizations experience and make sense of planned organizational change ? This phenomenographic (Marton, 1981, 2000) study explores the different ways stakeholders experience, conceptualize, and make sense of planned organizational change. The qualitative research design uses a constructivist, interpretivist approach to gathering data from stakeholders experiencing the Department of Defense's planned change. Weick's seven properties of sensemaking (1995; 2001) augment the analysis of the meaning aspect of their experiences. Conceptions about the change experience range from ""It's the right thing to do"" to ""It's the banner of the moment"" to ""It's political."" A key finding is the variation in participants' sensemaking. Members of the planner/implementer stakeholder group indicated more sources of support for their sensemaking than the contributor/recipient stakeholder group. This study makes four contributions. First, it contributes rich descriptions of internal stakeholders' experience of planned organizational change. Second, it demonstrates that sensemaking enhances the phenomenographic analysis of experience. Third, it reveals four variations in stakeholders' experience of planned organizational change, referred to as categories of description. These categories of description---aligned, conflicted, disillusioned, and dysfunctional---are presented in an empirical typology and reflect the participants' experiences of planned change. Finally, this study adds to the collective understanding of the human element of organizational transformation by offering a model of how internal stakeholders experience planned organizational change.",304914035,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Wagner, Ruth Scogna",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Transformation of organizational legacy logistics systems and facilitating an integrated lean enterprise: A case study within the United States Army,"This study examined the U.S. Army's Single Stock Fund (SSF) program, which is a business process initiative designed to reengineer the inventory management, finance, and accounting systems and to enable 49 general ledgers accounts Army-wide. The SSF program represented one of the most sweeping changes to the Army's logistics and business processes in the past 25 years. Its overall purpose was to provide the capability for Army transformation and to help the U.S. Army operate a military organization as if it were a large corporation. This study was designed to facilitate this effort by presenting an analysis of the Army's hard work to create a single virtual supply and maintenance organization by upgrading and putting in place the necessary automation systems that connect smoothly with the Commodity Command Standard System (CCSS) and the Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARRS). Ultimately, SSF led the path to the merging of the Logistics Modernization Program (LMP), the Global Combat Command Standard System - Army (GCSS - A), and the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM+) into a global Single Army Logistics Enterprise (SALE). After completion, the SSF consolidated the current wholesale, theatre, corps/installation, and division authorized stockage list inventories into a single, virtual supply and maintenance organization. This capability allowed the Army to streamline all the financing and inventories and the accounting system, thereby enabling the Army to operate more efficiently by putting in place many of the same business practices now standard in large corporations in the United States.",304910128,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Alcide, Daniel W.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2006," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Integrated lean enterprise , Legacy systems , Logistics systems , Organizational systems , United States Army", 978-0-542-86308-0,,, English, English,,,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/transformation-organizational-legacy-logistics/docview/304910128/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transformation+of+organizational+legacy+logistics+systems+and+facilitating+an+integrated+lean+enterprise%3A+A+case+study+within+the+United+States+Army&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alcide%2C+Daniel+W.&amp;isbn=978-0-542-86308-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,examined army single stock fund ssf program business process initiative designed reengineer inventory management finance accounting system enable general ledger account ssf program represented one sweeping change army logistics business process past year overall purpose provide capability army transformation help army operate organization large corporation designed facilitate effort presenting army hard work create single virtual supply maintenance organization upgrading putting place necessary automation system connect smoothly commodity command standard system ccss standard army retail supply system sarrs ultimately ssf led path merging logistics modernization program lmp global combat command standard system army gcss product lifecycle management global single army logistics enterprise sale completion ssf consolidated current wholesale theatre division authorized stockage list inventory single virtual supply maintenance organization capability allowed army streamline financing inventory accounting system thereby enabling army operate efficiently putting place many business practice standard large corporation united state,"['examined', 'army', 'single', 'stock', 'fund', 'ssf', 'program', 'business', 'process', 'initiative', 'designed', 'reengineer', 'inventory', 'management', 'finance', 'accounting', 'systems', 'enable', 'general', 'ledgers', 'accounts', 'ssf', 'program', 'represented', 'one', 'sweeping', 'changes', 'army', 'logistics', 'business', 'processes', 'past', 'years', 'overall', 'purpose', 'provide', 'capability', 'army', 'transformation', 'help', 'army', 'operate', 'organization', 'large', 'corporation', 'designed', 'facilitate', 'effort', 'presenting', 'army', 'hard', 'work', 'create', 'single', 'virtual', 'supply', 'maintenance', 'organization', 'upgrading', 'putting', 'place', 'necessary', 'automation', 'systems', 'connect', 'smoothly', 'commodity', 'command', 'standard', 'system', 'ccss', 'standard', 'army', 'retail', 'supply', 'system', 'sarrs', 'ultimately', 'ssf', 'led', 'path', 'merging', 'logistics', 'modernization', 'program', 'lmp', 'global', 'combat', 'command', 'standard', 'system', 'army', 'gcss', 'product', 'lifecycle', 'management', 'global', 'single', 'army', 'logistics', 'enterprise', 'sale', 'completion', 'ssf', 'consolidated', 'current', 'wholesale', 'theatre', 'division', 'authorized', 'stockage', 'list', 'inventories', 'single', 'virtual', 'supply', 'maintenance', 'organization', 'capability', 'allowed', 'army', 'streamline', 'financing', 'inventories', 'accounting', 'system', 'thereby', 'enabling', 'army', 'operate', 'efficiently', 'putting', 'place', 'many', 'business', 'practices', 'standard', 'large', 'corporations', 'united', 'states']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement

"Department of the Navy Business Transformation: The Road to a ""Clean"" Opinion","The challenge of the Department of the Navy is to sustain operational excellence that translates into mission accomplishment, while also maintaining fiscal accountability. Success will ultimately be measured by an acceptable audit opinion on DON financial statements. The strategy recognizes that DoD/DON financial managers do not produce the numbers that appear on financial statements. Rather, business operations are led by business managers, who produce financial information from their operations. As a result, the focus must be on the business processes, not just the reports or accounting systems that collect the information. In essence, the strategy integrates four significant, ongoing initiatives under one umbrella that recognizes the synergy and inter-relationships among them. The four initiatives are the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture, the Navy Enterprise Resource Planning Program, the Functional Area Manager Process, and the DON Financial Improvement Program. The new strategy places responsibility for improved financial information squarely where it belongs - on line managers who oversee and direct the business processes that produce the financial information and, more importantly, that support the critical warfighting mission.",194764753,,,Trade Journals,,"Easton, Mark", AFCMAF, Navy-US, Copyright American Society of Military Comptrollers Winter 2006,,, Feature,, Winter 2006," Business process , Business transformation , Accounting software , Navy",,0004-2188,1.0, English, English,, 15, Alexandria,Winter 2006,The Armed Forces Comptroller,2006,,51.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/department-navy-business-transformation-road/docview/194764753/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aaccounting&amp;atitle=Department+of+the+Navy+Business+Transformation%3A+The+Road+to+a+%26quot%3BClean%26quot%3B+Opinion&amp;title=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;issn=00042188&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=51&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=15&amp;au=Easton%2C+Mark&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",challenge navy sustain operational excellence translates mission accomplishment also maintaining fiscal accountability success ultimately measured acceptable audit opinion financial statement strategy recognizes financial manager produce number appear financial statement rather business operation led business manager produce financial information operation focus must business process report accounting system collect information essence strategy integrates four significant ongoing initiative one umbrella recognizes synergy among four initiative business enterprise architecture navy enterprise resource planning program functional area manager process financial improvement program new strategy place responsibility improved financial information squarely belongs line manager oversee direct business process produce financial information importantly support critical warfighting mission,"['challenge', 'navy', 'sustain', 'operational', 'excellence', 'translates', 'mission', 'accomplishment', 'also', 'maintaining', 'fiscal', 'accountability', 'success', 'ultimately', 'measured', 'acceptable', 'audit', 'opinion', 'financial', 'statements', 'strategy', 'recognizes', 'financial', 'managers', 'produce', 'numbers', 'appear', 'financial', 'statements', 'rather', 'business', 'operations', 'led', 'business', 'managers', 'produce', 'financial', 'information', 'operations', 'result', 'focus', 'must', 'business', 'processes', 'reports', 'accounting', 'systems', 'collect', 'information', 'essence', 'strategy', 'integrates', 'four', 'significant', 'ongoing', 'initiatives', 'one', 'umbrella', 'recognizes', 'synergy', 'among', 'four', 'initiatives', 'business', 'enterprise', 'architecture', 'navy', 'enterprise', 'resource', 'planning', 'program', 'functional', 'area', 'manager', 'process', 'financial', 'improvement', 'program', 'new', 'strategy', 'places', 'responsibility', 'improved', 'financial', 'information', 'squarely', 'belongs', 'line', 'managers', 'oversee', 'direct', 'business', 'processes', 'produce', 'financial', 'information', 'importantly', 'support', 'critical', 'warfighting', 'mission']",Feature,2,Process Improvement
Leaning the Antideficiency Act Process,"Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a business process reengineering method being used widely by the private sector to streamline processes, improve quality, and gain efficiencies in practices. LSS is project-driven and results-oriented. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) recently spearheaded LSS process reviews for several major Department of Defense (DoD) financial management processes. The OUSD(C) determined that the best solution to improve the Antideficiency Act (ADA) cycle time was to engage the military departments (MILDEP) in a week-long LSS session. The LSS team expects, at a minimum, a 40-day cycle time reduction. The new processes took effect in November 2005, and the LSS team will perform a six-month follow-up review. The communication and teamwork among the MILDEPs and OUSD(C) was of great benefit and should certainly help in achieving the ultimate goal-cycle time reduction.",194763382,,,Trade Journals,,"Cohen, Kathleen;Firer, Lauren", AFCMAF, Department of Defense, Copyright American Society of Military Comptrollers Winter 2006,,, Feature,, Winter 2006," Lean Six Sigma , Six Sigma , Standing , Business process re-engineering",,0004-2188,1.0, English, English,, 34, Alexandria,Winter 2006,The Armed Forces Comptroller,2006,,51.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/leaning-antideficiency-act-process/docview/194763382/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aaccounting&amp;atitle=Leaning+the+Antideficiency+Act+Process&amp;title=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;issn=00042188&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=51&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=34&amp;au=Cohen%2C+Kathleen%3BFirer%2C+Lauren&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",lean six sigma lss business process reengineering used widely private sector streamline process improve quality gain efficiency practice lss office secretary comptroller ousd recently spearheaded lss process review several major financial management process ousd determined best solution improve antideficiency act ada cycle time engage department mildep lss session lss team expects minimum cycle time reduction new process took effect november lss team perform review communication teamwork among mildeps ousd great benefit certainly help achieving ultimate time reduction,"['lean', 'six', 'sigma', 'lss', 'business', 'process', 'reengineering', 'used', 'widely', 'private', 'sector', 'streamline', 'processes', 'improve', 'quality', 'gain', 'efficiencies', 'practices', 'lss', 'office', 'secretary', 'comptroller', 'ousd', 'recently', 'spearheaded', 'lss', 'process', 'reviews', 'several', 'major', 'financial', 'management', 'processes', 'ousd', 'determined', 'best', 'solution', 'improve', 'antideficiency', 'act', 'ada', 'cycle', 'time', 'engage', 'departments', 'mildep', 'lss', 'session', 'lss', 'team', 'expects', 'minimum', 'cycle', 'time', 'reduction', 'new', 'processes', 'took', 'effect', 'november', 'lss', 'team', 'perform', 'review', 'communication', 'teamwork', 'among', 'mildeps', 'ousd', 'great', 'benefit', 'certainly', 'help', 'achieving', 'ultimate', 'time', 'reduction']",Feature,2,Process Improvement

Strategic communication in the systems age: A unified theory in complex adaptive information environments,"This paper seeks to develop a unified theory for strategic communication within the Department of Defense and explores the complex interrelationships of audiences in the systems age, as well as how the creation of a globalized information environment makes strategic communications an imperative for the U.S. government. The problem is that governmental strategic communications may be too complex for traditional bureaucratic organizations, and so it may be necessary to shed a bureaucratic approach in favor of an effect-based, audience oriented process. The objective of this research and modified strategic communications methodology is to offer a compelling argument for organizational coordination in communications. This approach focuses upon the unique behavior and role of social perception in four major audience groups, and attempts to harmonize organizational communications through an appreciation of global audience complexities in systems age.",1654459402,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"King, Daniel J.

Clearing THE PAPER TRAIL,"  Pratt &amp; Whitney is taking a conservative approach to the rollout, said [Mike Hawman] and iBASEt Director of Business Development Conrad Leiva. While the customer had a high degree of confidence in the vendor, Pratt &amp; Whitney, seeking to ensure a smooth transition, asked iBASEt to set up Solumina to produce paper at key end-points in the instruction process, such as at the task-card level. Leiva dubs this Pratt's ""paper-light"" phase, and said iBASEt had to tweak its software so that it would produce paper, noting the company was ""glad to do so."" Lockheed Martin's Greenville Aircraft Center, an airframe heavy maintenance facility, targeted a very specific metric as part of efficiency improvements: the amount of time wrapped up in its non-routine inspection and repair approval process. The shop, which overhauls multiple versions of C-130s, C-9s and P-3s for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines, generates some 45,000 discrepancy reports per year, said Lee Withington, a subject matter expert in Lockheed Martin's LM21 program, which seeks company-wide improvements using Lean and Six Sigma. Each discrepancy report represents one non-routine repair that could be done on an aircraft in for a routine heavy check, and each report usually is accompanied by several pages of supporting documentation, as well as multiple carbon copies of the original. According to Withington, Lockheed Martin's customers reject about 18 percent of the discrepancy report repairs, making them NBNC, or noted but not corrected, items. In other words, Lockheed Martin's work to produce and distribute the paperwork on nearly 20 percent of the discrepancies its inspectors find on non-routine checks is wasted. Throw in that the report details are recorded on paper and, on average, five days pass between the time an inspector files a discrepancy report and a mechanic begins fixing it, and Lockheed Martin had some obvious targets for process improvement.

Implementing Lean,"  In researching this article, O&amp;M found numerous examples of how Lean, Six Sigma and other manufacturing and service-enhancing concepts benefited civilian [MROs] and military depots. The magazine did not find any instances in which Lean failed, but several MROs and Lean experts indicated that applying a few Lean elements will not guarantee a successful Lean operation. Lean and Six Sigma principles appear to fit in with DOD's cost cutting and size reducing initiatives. In April 2004, DOD issued a broad policy that included a mandate for better maintenance processes at various depots and in the field. The mandate is part of the Continuous Process Improvement program initiated by DOD four years ago. In a recent interview, [David Pauling] said the next phase to improve maintenance processes would require that contractors have some elements of Lean or Six Sigma in place. A DOD-led syllabus to teach Lean and other efficiency-related principles is being developed. Determining exactly how much an MRO invested in its Lean transformation is a difficult nut to crack. A number of MROs and OEMs declined to give specific figures on implementing Lean. Part of their reticence is due to confidentiality agreements with customers. But some admitted that they didn't want to publish the exact cost to implement Lean, or the time it took to obtain the return on investment, or project revenue increases due to Lean because of how the figures might be perceived or misrepresented by competitors. However, a few MROs were willing to approximate the cost of Lean.",223665342,,,Trade Journals,,"Moorman, Robert W",,," Copyright (c) 2005 The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

An innovative approach to schedule management on the F /A-22 Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP): Demonstration of critical Chain Project Management,"This multiple-case-based dissertation contributes to the stream of literature on the organizational innovation process by examining Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) as an innovation with the potential to address an important schedule planning and execution performance gap in DOD weapon system development programs. The contextually different Integrated Product Team case studies in DOD's F/A-22 fighter aircraft weapons system acquisition program are: manufacturing assembly, manufacturing process, test operations, and supplier product development. Rich descriptions of the case studies are developed by the author, a senior Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company systems engineer in a role that merged participant, observer, change agent and champion (POCAC). Analysis distinguishes between Program and Operational levels of organizational structure and focuses on the innovation process through use of the author-designed Casey Hybrid Innovation Process (CHIP) model based on Rogers' stages heuristic. Substantively, research demonstrates that in key areas of the F/A-22 program, proper application of the innovative Critical Chain Project Management process can generate and achieve development schedules sometimes substantially better than traditional approaches; improper application will lead to mixed results or rejection. The research contributes to knowledge in the field of organizational innovation by demonstrating use of the CHIP model in the huge, geographically dispersed and extremely complex organization of the largest DOD weapon system acquisition program of the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries. The research reflects Program leadership's important role in the top-down initiation and support of an innovation, even while choosing (by policy) not to force use at the Operational level. At the Operational level, details show that IPT implementations and results of the CCPM innovation vary.",305382575,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Casey, Robert James",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2005," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Critical Chain Project Management , Department of Defense , Major Defense Acquisition Program , Organizational innovation , Project management , Schedule management", 978-0-542-09405-7,,, English, English,,,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/innovative-approach-schedule-management-on-f-22/docview/305382575/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+innovative+approach+to+schedule+management+on+the+F+%2FA-22+Major+Defense+Acquisition+Program+%28MDAP%29%3A+Demonstration+of+critical+Chain+Project+Management&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Casey%2C+Robert+James&amp;isbn=978-0-542-09405-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,contributes stream literature organizational innovation process examining critical chain project management ccpm innovation potential address important schedule planning execution performance gap weapon system development program contextually different integrated product team case study fighter aircraft weapon system acquisition program manufacturing assembly manufacturing process test operation supplier product development rich description case study developed author senior lockheed martin aeronautics company system engineer role merged participant observer change agent champion pocac distinguishes program operational level organizational structure focus innovation process use casey hybrid innovation process chip model based rogers stage heuristic substantively demonstrates key area program proper application innovative critical chain project management process generate achieve development schedule sometimes substantially better traditional approach improper application lead mixed result rejection contributes knowledge field organizational innovation demonstrating use chip model huge geographically dispersed extremely complex organization largest weapon system acquisition program late early century reflects program leadership important role initiation support innovation even choosing policy force use operational level operational level detail show ipt implementation result ccpm innovation vary,"['dissertation', 'contributes', 'stream', 'literature', 'organizational', 'innovation', 'process', 'examining', 'critical', 'chain', 'project', 'management', 'ccpm', 'innovation', 'potential', 'address', 'important', 'schedule', 'planning', 'execution', 'performance', 'gap', 'weapon', 'system', 'development', 'programs', 'contextually', 'different', 'integrated', 'product', 'team', 'case', 'studies', 'fighter', 'aircraft', 'weapons', 'system', 'acquisition', 'program', 'manufacturing', 'assembly', 'manufacturing', 'process', 'test', 'operations', 'supplier', 'product', 'development', 'rich', 'descriptions', 'case', 'studies', 'developed', 'author', 'senior', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'aeronautics', 'company', 'systems', 'engineer', 'role', 'merged', 'participant', 'observer', 'change', 'agent', 'champion', 'pocac', 'distinguishes', 'program', 'operational', 'levels', 'organizational', 'structure', 'focuses', 'innovation', 'process', 'use', 'casey', 'hybrid', 'innovation', 'process', 'chip', 'model', 'based', 'rogers', 'stages', 'heuristic', 'substantively', 'demonstrates', 'key', 'areas', 'program', 'proper', 'application', 'innovative', 'critical', 'chain', 'project', 'management', 'process', 'generate', 'achieve', 'development', 'schedules', 'sometimes', 'substantially', 'better', 'traditional', 'approaches', 'improper', 'application', 'lead', 'mixed', 'results', 'rejection', 'contributes', 'knowledge', 'field', 'organizational', 'innovation', 'demonstrating', 'use', 'chip', 'model', 'huge', 'geographically', 'dispersed', 'extremely', 'complex', 'organization', 'largest', 'weapon', 'system', 'acquisition', 'program', 'late', 'early', 'centuries', 'reflects', 'program', 'leadership', 'important', 'role', 'initiation', 'support', 'innovation', 'even', 'choosing', 'policy', 'force', 'use', 'operational', 'level', 'operational', 'level', 'details', 'show', 'ipt', 'implementations', 'results', 'ccpm', 'innovation', 'vary']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Management and Leadership
A comparison of three hydrological simulations in a northern environment,"Accurate streamflow predictions are essential for a large number of applications, including flood forecasting and the management of water resources, and water quality. Satisfactory estimation of the energy fluxes from the land surface that feed back to the atmosphere is an important component in climate and weather forecasting. Interactions between hydrology and climate are extremely important in relation to long-term water resources planning. Water and energy are the mechanisms that explain the complex interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere. To analyze the coupled water and energy budgets in a basin, Surface-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) schemes and hydrological models with different levels of complexity are linked. It would be reasonable to expect that the theoretical accuracy of the more sophisticated SVAT hydrological models would lead to improved accuracy. This topic is the main investigation of this research. The study here reported shows a comparison of three models with different levels of complexity. Two are based on SVAT schemes, namely, the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) and the Interactions Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface scheme linked with the hydrological model WATFLOOD (i.e., WATISBA and WATCLASS). The third is the WATFLOOD model itself. The three models are compared in a data-rich environment using the hydrometeorological information collected during the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere (BOREAS) study, which took place between 1994 and 1996 in Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada. Data for two study areas, the Northern Study Area (NSA) near Thompson, Manitoba, and the Southern Study Area (SSA) north of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, are used to calibrate and validate the models. The goal of the comparison was to investigate the level of complexity necessary to obtain in small watersheds (representative of the grid cell size in atmospheric models) a good agreement between the evapotranspiration, soil moisture, snowpack, and energy flux simulations, and the point scale measurements at different flux tower sites, as well as the streamflow at time scales of one hour and above. To accomplish this goal, one of the main components of this investigation is to develop the “off line” linkage between the WATFLOOD hydrological model and the version of the ISBA SVAT scheme implemented in the Canadian Numerical Weather Forecast Model at Environment Canada (ISBA-CMC).

Visionary technology leadership from Admiral Hyman G. Rickover to masters of the information age,"This doctoral dissertation examines the evolution of technology leadership in the U.S. Navy beginning with Admiral Hyman G. Rickover to the current era and extends to private sector practices. It ponders the question of how visionary leadership is exercised to deliver transformational change through technology. The thesis presented argues that visionary leaders must exercise the capability to advance their vision, exercise professional experience in advancing that vision, and that they must demonstrate the leadership capacity to gather talented people and sponsors to their cause. These leaders must also accept ultimate accountability for their creations and recognize the intended and unintended consequences of their technologies. That research question also extends to exploring the consequences of accepting or rejecting disruptive technology in the information age. This dissertation has relevance beyond the Navy and explores current technology innovation methods and insights. A technology focus on information technology (IT) is maintained to enhance the value of the research in an age where IT is a dominant driver of change that directly impacts everyone. The emerging technology leadership and governance discipline inspired the need for this research. Dissertation research and observations are offered on visionary leadership within the context of the humanities. The fundamental question of the Salve Regina University doctoral program is: What does it mean to be human in an age of advanced technology? The more specific question answered in this dissertation is: What does it mean to be human in an age of advanced technology while serving in positions of decision-making leadership? Being a person responsible for introducing, sustaining, and delivering technology and its governance has special meaning. The Salve Regina University doctoral program is grounded in this context which is a fairly unique approach to the study of technology and its impact on humans.",305349715,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Bundy, William F.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2005," Social sciences , Information age , Leadership , Rickover, Hyman George , Technology , United States Navy , Visionary", 978-0-542-05882-0,,, English, English,,,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/visionary-technology-leadership-admiral-hyman-g/docview/305349715/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Visionary+technology+leadership+from+Admiral+Hyman+G.+Rickover+to+masters+of+the+information+age&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bundy%2C+William+F.&amp;isbn=978-0-542-05882-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,doctoral examines evolution technology leadership navy beginning admiral hyman rickover current era extends private sector practice ponders question visionary leadership exercised deliver transformational change technology presented argues visionary leader must exercise capability advance vision exercise professional experience advancing vision must demonstrate leadership capacity gather talented people sponsor cause leader must also accept ultimate accountability creation recognize intended unintended consequence technology question also extends exploring consequence accepting rejecting disruptive technology information age relevance beyond navy explores current technology innovation method insight technology focus information technology maintained enhance value age dominant driver change directly impact everyone emerging technology leadership governance discipline inspired need observation offered visionary leadership within context humanity fundamental question salve regina doctoral program mean human age advanced technology specific question answered mean human age advanced technology serving position leadership person responsible introducing sustaining delivering technology governance special meaning salve regina doctoral program grounded context fairly unique technology impact human,"['doctoral', 'dissertation', 'examines', 'evolution', 'technology', 'leadership', 'navy', 'beginning', 'admiral', 'hyman', 'rickover', 'current', 'era', 'extends', 'private', 'sector', 'practices', 'ponders', 'question', 'visionary', 'leadership', 'exercised', 'deliver', 'transformational', 'change', 'technology', 'thesis', 'presented', 'argues', 'visionary', 'leaders', 'must', 'exercise', 'capability', 'advance', 'vision', 'exercise', 'professional', 'experience', 'advancing', 'vision', 'must', 'demonstrate', 'leadership', 'capacity', 'gather', 'talented', 'people', 'sponsors', 'cause', 'leaders', 'must', 'also', 'accept', 'ultimate', 'accountability', 'creations', 'recognize', 'intended', 'unintended', 'consequences', 'technologies', 'question', 'also', 'extends', 'exploring', 'consequences', 'accepting', 'rejecting', 'disruptive', 'technology', 'information', 'age', 'dissertation', 'relevance', 'beyond', 'navy', 'explores', 'current', 'technology', 'innovation', 'methods', 'insights', 'technology', 'focus', 'information', 'technology', 'maintained', 'enhance', 'value', 'age', 'dominant', 'driver', 'change', 'directly', 'impacts', 'everyone', 'emerging', 'technology', 'leadership', 'governance', 'discipline', 'inspired', 'need', 'dissertation', 'observations', 'offered', 'visionary', 'leadership', 'within', 'context', 'humanities', 'fundamental', 'question', 'salve', 'regina', 'university', 'doctoral', 'program', 'mean', 'human', 'age', 'advanced', 'technology', 'specific', 'question', 'answered', 'dissertation', 'mean', 'human', 'age', 'advanced', 'technology', 'serving', 'positions', 'leadership', 'person', 'responsible', 'introducing', 'sustaining', 'delivering', 'technology', 'governance', 'special', 'meaning', 'salve', 'regina', 'university', 'doctoral', 'program', 'grounded', 'context', 'fairly', 'unique', 'technology', 'impact', 'humans']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Substitutes for job satisfaction: Family -supportive programs,"Job satisfaction may be the single most studied variable in organizations because of the centrality of employees to organizational success. As the number of single parent households and dual-earner households have increased, the conflict between work and family have increased. In response to these changes, many employers offer increased flexibility to their employees in how, where, and when the employee performs so as to allow employees the opportunity to reduce the work-family conflict. This study uses the revised Job Diagnostic Survey and the satisfaction with Work Schedule Flexibility instruments to explore how availability and use of family supportive programs within a Department of Defense Agency affects employee satisfaction. The findings suggest that the use of family supportive programs do not increase employee satisfaction, but the lack of such programs may increase employee dissatisfaction.",305348619,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Day, Theresa A.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2005," Social sciences , Psychology , Family-supportive , Flexible scheduling , Job satisfaction", 978-0-542-43947-6,,, English, English,,,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/substitutes-job-satisfaction-family-supportive/docview/305348619/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Substitutes+for+job+satisfaction%3A+Family+-supportive+programs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Day%2C+Theresa+A.&amp;isbn=978-0-542-43947-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,job satisfaction may single studied variable organization centrality employee organizational success number single parent household household increased conflict work family increased response change many employer offer increased flexibility employee employee performs allow employee opportunity reduce conflict us revised job diagnostic survey satisfaction work schedule flexibility instrument explore availability use family supportive program within agency affect employee satisfaction finding suggest use family supportive program increase employee satisfaction lack program may increase employee dissatisfaction,"['job', 'satisfaction', 'may', 'single', 'studied', 'variable', 'organizations', 'centrality', 'employees', 'organizational', 'success', 'number', 'single', 'parent', 'households', 'households', 'increased', 'conflict', 'work', 'family', 'increased', 'response', 'changes', 'many', 'employers', 'offer', 'increased', 'flexibility', 'employees', 'employee', 'performs', 'allow', 'employees', 'opportunity', 'reduce', 'conflict', 'uses', 'revised', 'job', 'diagnostic', 'survey', 'satisfaction', 'work', 'schedule', 'flexibility', 'instruments', 'explore', 'availability', 'use', 'family', 'supportive', 'programs', 'within', 'agency', 'affects', 'employee', 'satisfaction', 'findings', 'suggest', 'use', 'family', 'supportive', 'programs', 'increase', 'employee', 'satisfaction', 'lack', 'programs', 'may', 'increase', 'employee', 'dissatisfaction']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
Business process characterization using categorical data models,"Variation exists in all processes, especially business processes where critical variables may be controlled by human intervention. Significant returns may be realized by identifying and removing sources of variation from business processes. Because business processes tend to be heavily dependent on human interaction, they can be difficult to characterize and model. This research develops a methodology for synthesizing the qualitative information about the performance of a business process and transforming it into specifically defined categorical data that can be used for statistical modeling and optimization. The process under investigation is the identification and pursuit of new business opportunities for a Department of Defense (DoD) prime contractor. This process is heavily dependent on the people who obtain information about potential opportunities and make decisions about whether to pursue an identified opportunity. This research explores methods for taking the demographic, anecdotal and qualitative data associated with particular business opportunities and creating categorical data sets that can be statistically modeled. This research illustrates how binary logistic regression was used to analyze these data and establish significant relationships between these key process attributes and the process outcome which is either the win or loss of the opportunity.",305027113,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Lawson, Catherine A.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2005," Applied sciences , Business opportunities , Department of Defense", 978-0-542-01410-9,,, English, English,,,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/business-process-characterization-using/docview/305027113/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Business+process+characterization+using+categorical+data+models&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lawson%2C+Catherine+A.&amp;isbn=978-0-542-01410-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,variation exists process especially business process critical variable may controlled human intervention significant return may realized identifying removing source variation business process business process tend heavily dependent human interaction difficult characterize model develops synthesizing qualitative information performance business process transforming specifically defined categorical used statistical modeling optimization process investigation identification pursuit new business opportunity prime contractor process heavily dependent people obtain information potential opportunity make decision whether pursue identified opportunity explores method taking demographic anecdotal qualitative associated particular business opportunity creating categorical set statistically modeled illustrates binary logistic regression used analyze establish significant relationship key process attribute process outcome either win loss opportunity,"['variation', 'exists', 'processes', 'especially', 'business', 'processes', 'critical', 'variables', 'may', 'controlled', 'human', 'intervention', 'significant', 'returns', 'may', 'realized', 'identifying', 'removing', 'sources', 'variation', 'business', 'processes', 'business', 'processes', 'tend', 'heavily', 'dependent', 'human', 'interaction', 'difficult', 'characterize', 'model', 'develops', 'synthesizing', 'qualitative', 'information', 'performance', 'business', 'process', 'transforming', 'specifically', 'defined', 'categorical', 'data', 'used', 'statistical', 'modeling', 'optimization', 'process', 'investigation', 'identification', 'pursuit', 'new', 'business', 'opportunities', 'prime', 'contractor', 'process', 'heavily', 'dependent', 'people', 'obtain', 'information', 'potential', 'opportunities', 'make', 'decisions', 'whether', 'pursue', 'identified', 'opportunity', 'explores', 'methods', 'taking', 'demographic', 'anecdotal', 'qualitative', 'data', 'associated', 'particular', 'business', 'opportunities', 'creating', 'categorical', 'data', 'sets', 'statistically', 'modeled', 'illustrates', 'binary', 'logistic', 'regression', 'used', 'analyze', 'data', 'establish', 'significant', 'relationships', 'key', 'process', 'attributes', 'process', 'outcome', 'either', 'win', 'loss', 'opportunity']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement
PUTTING VALUE BACK INTO ENGINEERING,"Value engineering, like statistical quality control and operations research, had its roots in the second World War effort to support American industry as the 'factory of the world' for the allied forces. This methodology was further developed over the next two decades based on experience with the Bureau of Ships in the United States Navy in 1954 and it matured in the 1960's after it was adopted for use by the United States Department of Defense in 1961. The methods of value engineering were documented by founder Lawrence D. Miles in the early 1970s. Subsequently, this methodology has been taught and promulgated widely; however, the biggest consumer of value engineering is the United States Federal Government who has mandated it for major military procurement and construction projects. Furthermore, the concepts and methods applied in Value engineering have influenced the development of Quality Function Deployment (QFD), the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving (TRIZ), and the lean methods of the Toyota Production System (TPS). However, the initial intellectual framework of value engineering did not kept pace with the times and the methodology was not extended based on the learning achieved from its infusion into other analytical methods. In this paper an approach is presented for updating the methods of value engineering to align it with the intellectual progress of the past three decades.

"CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF THE NATIONAL BIODEFENSE ANALYSIS AND COUNTERMEASURES CENTER (NBACC) FACILITY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AT FORT DETRICK, MARYLAND. [Part 1 of 1]","PURPOSE: The construction and operation of a National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) facility at Fort Detrick, Maryland are proposed by the Department of Homeland Security. The facility, which would be located on a site adjacent to the existing U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, would provide for research and development of means of defending the country against attacks using biological agents. The facility would be composed of the Biological Threat Characterization Center, which will conduct research to help understand current and future biological threats and the National Biodefense Analysis Center, which would act as the lead federal agency for conducting biodefense analysis of evidence from bio-crimes or terrorist attacks to attain a ""biological fingerprint"" to determine the origin and mechanisms of the agents. The facility would provide 160,000 gross square feet of space for biological threat characterization and bioforensic operations and research laboratories, animal facilities, mechanical equipment, waste handling, and administrative support offices. The building footprint would cover 80,000 square feet, which would be complemented by 112,200 square feet of loading dock apron, and other ancillary access and landscaping features. The construction phase of the project would commence in the first quarter of 2006 and could require up to 30 months to complete. In addition to the proposed action, this final EIS considers a No Action Alternative. Three additional alternatives for the NBACC facility were considered but rejected as unreasonable. POSITIVE IMPACTS: The NBACC would help reduce the vulnerability of the American public to terrorist attack and to minimize the damage of such an attack and assist in recovery efforts. More specifically, the center would provide a scientific basis for awareness of biological threats and attribution of their use against the American public by understanding current and future biological threats, assessing vulnerabilities, and determining potential impacts to guide the development of countermeasures and by providing national capability to conduct forensic analysis of evidence from bio-crimes and terrorism to attain a ""biological fingerprint"" to identify perpetrators and determine the origin and method of attack. NEGATIVE IMPACTS: The NBACC building would displace 1.84 acres, and the associated access and landscaping features would displace an additional 2.58 acres. Low-lying vegetation would be destroyed and the extent of impermeable surface would increase, increasing storm water runoff somewhat. LEGAL MANDATES: Homeland Security Act (P.L. 107-296).

Blasgen says ConAgra is piloting and trying to understand how the technology can improve the process. Esteves advises anyone who is going to so this to look at their own business processes and figure out where their own benefit can be. In terms of testing, Pauling says a lab should replicate what you do in your normal day-to-day activities.

IT Portfolio Management,"The Information Technology (IT) Portfolio Management workshop served as an example of the excellent training provided. The workshop presented a wealth of information pertaining to current and forthcoming policies affecting the ability of the Department of Defense (DoD) to manage its IT investment using the portfolio approach. The DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) has four goals for IT management: 1. become a mission partner, 2. provide services that satisfy customer information needs, 3. reform the information technology management process to increase efficiency and mission contribution, and 4. ensure that DoD's vital information resources are secure and protected. Portfolio management uses the Capital Planning and Investment Control activities to work toward achieving the CIO's goals. There are four key components: Analysis, Selection, Control, and Evaluation. The DoD portfolio domains are at different stages of the development, with the Business Mission Area being the one most fully defined. The DoD Business Management Modernization Program (BMMP) and IT Portfolio Management are included in this domain, and definitions and governance already have been established.",194778202,,,Trade Journals,,"Wright, Sandra", AFCMAF, Department of Defense, Copyright American Society of Military Comptrollers Summer 2004,,, Feature,, Summer 2004," IT portfolio management , Management , Portfolio management , Technology management , Portfolio",,0004-2188,3.0, English, English,, 34-37, Alexandria,Summer 2004,The Armed Forces Comptroller,2004,,49.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/portfolio-management/docview/194778202/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aaccounting&amp;atitle=IT+Portfolio+Management&amp;title=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;issn=00042188&amp;date=2004-07-01&amp;volume=49&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=34&amp;au=Wright%2C+Sandra&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",information technology portfolio management workshop served example excellent training provided workshop presented wealth information pertaining current forthcoming policy affecting ability manage investment using portfolio chief information officer cio four goal management become mission partner provide service satisfy customer information need reform information technology management process increase efficiency mission contribution ensure vital information resource secure protected portfolio management us capital planning investment control activity work toward achieving cio goal four key component selection control evaluation portfolio domain different stage development business mission area one fully defined business management modernization program bmmp portfolio management included domain definition governance already established,"['information', 'technology', 'portfolio', 'management', 'workshop', 'served', 'example', 'excellent', 'training', 'provided', 'workshop', 'presented', 'wealth', 'information', 'pertaining', 'current', 'forthcoming', 'policies', 'affecting', 'ability', 'manage', 'investment', 'using', 'portfolio', 'chief', 'information', 'officer', 'cio', 'four', 'goals', 'management', 'become', 'mission', 'partner', 'provide', 'services', 'satisfy', 'customer', 'information', 'needs', 'reform', 'information', 'technology', 'management', 'process', 'increase', 'efficiency', 'mission', 'contribution', 'ensure', 'vital', 'information', 'resources', 'secure', 'protected', 'portfolio', 'management', 'uses', 'capital', 'planning', 'investment', 'control', 'activities', 'work', 'toward', 'achieving', 'cio', 'goals', 'four', 'key', 'components', 'selection', 'control', 'evaluation', 'portfolio', 'domains', 'different', 'stages', 'development', 'business', 'mission', 'area', 'one', 'fully', 'defined', 'business', 'management', 'modernization', 'program', 'bmmp', 'portfolio', 'management', 'included', 'domain', 'definitions', 'governance', 'already', 'established']",Feature,2,Management and Leadership
Pentagon Devises Innovative IT Strategy,"The U.S. Department of Defense is emerging as a pioneer in systems architectures. The DOD has become an innovator in supporting real-time responsiveness across an enterprise. The DOD is stuck with the fixed costs to support well over $1 trillion worth of accumulation from mainframe- and desktop-centric acquisitions. To escape that bondage and confront rapidly rising threats to our security, the DOD has come up with an architecture that meets the new requirements at materially lower costs. It's an architecture that makes it possible to migrate rapidly without the resulting chaos seen in the efforts to modernize information systems for the Navy and the Marine Corps. The objective of the GIG is to move all DOD applications from the current broadcast, point-to-point and interapplication communications to a virtual and secure, enterprisewide ultrawideband bus. It's based on the operating doctrine of posting information and knowledge for real-time availability by means of universal data-elementlevel interoperability.",216102448,,,Trade Journals,,"Strassmann, Paul A", CMPWAB, Department of Defense," Copyright Computerworld Inc.

Reducing the transport of herbicides and herbicide metabolites from agricultural application zones with vegetated filter strips,"There are conflicting reports in the literature concerning vegetated filter strips (VFS) and the contribution of a sorption mechanism to herbicide trapping efficiency (TE). Moreover, adsorption, desorption, and mineralization of herbicide metabolites in vegetated filter strip soil (VFSS) have not been evaluated. Yet, these data are needed to predict the transport of these compounds through VFSS. To address the contribution of herbicide mass adsorbed (M as ) to TE, simulated runon experiments were conducted to compare TE and M as among metolachlor, metolachlor oxanilic acid (OA), and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (ESA) in buffalograss filter strips. Subsequently, the potential transport of these compounds was assessed in laboratory experiments where adsorption, desorption, and mineralization parameters were compared between a cultivated Houston Black clay (CS) and an adjacent VFS established in a mixed stand of bermudagrass and buffalograss. Parallel field and laboratory experiments were conducted with atrazine, desethylatrazine (DEA), deisopropylatrazine (DIA), diaminoatrazine (DA), and hydroxyatrazine (HA). In the field experiment, TE was greater for metolachlor (25.3%) compared to OA (15.5%) and ESA (14.2%). Significantly more metolachlor (17.3%) was retained as M as compared to either metabolite (≤7.0%). An identical trend was observed in the atrazine study. These data demonstrate that sorption to the VFS sorbents (grass, grass thatch, and/or soil surface) is an important retention mechanism. Retention differences among compounds were attributed to hydrophobic interactions among the compounds and the VFS sorbents. In the laboratory experiments, organic carbon content, microbial activity, microbial numbers, and soil enzymatic activity were higher in the VFSS compared to the adjacent CS. Sorption and mineralization data for metolachlor, ESA, and OA indicate that the transport of these compounds is reduced in the VFSS. In contrast, our sorption and mineralization data for atrazine, DEA, and HA demonstrate that the transport of these compounds may not be reduced in the VFSS. However, the potential transport of DIA is lower in the VFSS.",305076534,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Krutz, Larry Jason",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2004," Biological sciences , Atrazine , Clay soil , Herbicides , Metolachlor , Vegetated filter strips", 978-0-496-88932-7,,, English, English,,,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/reducing-transport-herbicides-herbicide/docview/305076534/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reducing+the+transport+of+herbicides+and+herbicide+metabolites+from+agricultural+application+zones+with+vegetated+filter+strips&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Krutz%2C+Larry+Jason&amp;isbn=978-0-496-88932-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,conflicting report literature concerning vegetated filter strip vfs contribution sorption mechanism herbicide trapping efficiency moreover adsorption desorption mineralization herbicide metabolite vegetated filter strip soil vfss evaluated yet needed predict transport compound vfss address contribution herbicide mass adsorbed simulated runon experiment conducted compare among metolachlor metolachlor oxanilic acid metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid esa buffalograss filter strip subsequently potential transport compound assessed laboratory experiment adsorption desorption mineralization parameter compared cultivated houston black clay adjacent vfs established mixed stand bermudagrass buffalograss parallel field laboratory experiment conducted atrazine desethylatrazine dea deisopropylatrazine dia diaminoatrazine hydroxyatrazine field experiment greater metolachlor compared esa significantly metolachlor retained compared either metabolite identical trend observed atrazine demonstrate sorption vfs sorbent grass grass thatch soil surface important retention mechanism retention difference among compound attributed hydrophobic interaction among compound vfs sorbent laboratory experiment organic carbon content microbial activity microbial number soil enzymatic activity higher vfss compared adjacent sorption mineralization metolachlor esa indicate transport compound reduced vfss contrast sorption mineralization atrazine dea demonstrate transport compound may reduced vfss however potential transport dia lower vfss,"['conflicting', 'reports', 'literature', 'concerning', 'vegetated', 'filter', 'strips', 'vfs', 'contribution', 'sorption', 'mechanism', 'herbicide', 'trapping', 'efficiency', 'moreover', 'adsorption', 'desorption', 'mineralization', 'herbicide', 'metabolites', 'vegetated', 'filter', 'strip', 'soil', 'vfss', 'evaluated', 'yet', 'data', 'needed', 'predict', 'transport', 'compounds', 'vfss', 'address', 'contribution', 'herbicide', 'mass', 'adsorbed', 'simulated', 'runon', 'experiments', 'conducted', 'compare', 'among', 'metolachlor', 'metolachlor', 'oxanilic', 'acid', 'metolachlor', 'ethanesulfonic', 'acid', 'esa', 'buffalograss', 'filter', 'strips', 'subsequently', 'potential', 'transport', 'compounds', 'assessed', 'laboratory', 'experiments', 'adsorption', 'desorption', 'mineralization', 'parameters', 'compared', 'cultivated', 'houston', 'black', 'clay', 'adjacent', 'vfs', 'established', 'mixed', 'stand', 'bermudagrass', 'buffalograss', 'parallel', 'field', 'laboratory', 'experiments', 'conducted', 'atrazine', 'desethylatrazine', 'dea', 'deisopropylatrazine', 'dia', 'diaminoatrazine', 'hydroxyatrazine', 'field', 'experiment', 'greater', 'metolachlor', 'compared', 'esa', 'significantly', 'metolachlor', 'retained', 'compared', 'either', 'metabolite', 'identical', 'trend', 'observed', 'atrazine', 'data', 'demonstrate', 'sorption', 'vfs', 'sorbents', 'grass', 'grass', 'thatch', 'soil', 'surface', 'important', 'retention', 'mechanism', 'retention', 'differences', 'among', 'compounds', 'attributed', 'hydrophobic', 'interactions', 'among', 'compounds', 'vfs', 'sorbents', 'laboratory', 'experiments', 'organic', 'carbon', 'content', 'microbial', 'activity', 'microbial', 'numbers', 'soil', 'enzymatic', 'activity', 'higher', 'vfss', 'compared', 'adjacent', 'sorption', 'mineralization', 'data', 'metolachlor', 'esa', 'indicate', 'transport', 'compounds', 'reduced', 'vfss', 'contrast', 'sorption', 'mineralization', 'data', 'atrazine', 'dea', 'demonstrate', 'transport', 'compounds', 'may', 'reduced', 'vfss', 'however', 'potential', 'transport', 'dia', 'lower', 'vfss']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
"CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF AN INTEGRATED RESEARCH FACILITY (IRF) BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) AT FORT DETRICK, MARYLAND. [Part 1 of 1]","PURPOSE: The construction and operation of an integrated research facility (IRF) by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at Fort Detrick, Maryland is proposed. The IRF, which would be located on a site adjacent to the existing U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases Facilities, would be comprised of laboratories designed to enable the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a component of NIH, to safely study disease-causing microbes. NIAID conducts and supports basic and applied research to prevent, diagnose, and treat infectious and immune-mediated illnesses, including human imunodeficientcy virus, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, other sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, malaria, autoimmune disorders, asthma, and allergies. Recently NIAID's resources and expertise have been increasingly applied to biodefense research via the study of disease-causing microbes. The proposed facilities would include intramural NIAID Biosafety Levels (BSL) 2, 3, and 4 laboratory and animal research units for the purpose of conducting NIAID biodefense and emerging infections research. The IRF facility would have a building footprint of 75,000 square feet and an adjoining parking lot covering 35,000 square feet. The building could provide as much as 150,000 gross square feet of floor space. Research at the Fort Detrick site would address pathogenesis, immune response, vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics, with a focus on gaining answers to clinical questions with broad public health implications. In particular, the NIAID IRF would address the need for increased BSL-4 capability, minimizing risk of exposure to potential hazardous agents for laboratory workers and the outside environment. In addition to the proposed action, this final EIS considers a No Action Alternative. The consolidated federal government appropriations for fiscal year 2003 included $105 million to fund the project. POSITIVE IMPACTS: Research at the new facility would contribute to the development and improvement of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapies to protect civilians from biological agents used by domestic and international terrorists. The research would have important implications for medical approaches to all emerging infectious diseases. The facilities would complement NIAID's overall biodefense research program at other NIH and NIH-supported research sites. NEGATIVE IMPACTS: Facilities construction would require the clearance of small areas of forested land and the displacement of open recreational space. The site would be affected by the presence of potential sinkhole sites. The site would generate additional hazardous chemical and biological wastes to be treated at the fort.

"CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF AN INTEGRATED RESEARCH FACILITY (IRF) BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) AT FORT DETRICK, MARYLAND. [Part 1 of 1]","PURPOSE: The construction and operation of an integrated research facility (IRF) by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at Fort Detrick, Maryland is proposed. The IRF, which would be located on a site adjacent to the existing U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases Facilities, would be comprised of laboratories designed to enable the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a component of NIH, to safely study disease-causing microbes. NIAID conducts and supports basic and applied research to prevent, diagnose, and treat infectious and immune-mediated illnesses, including human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, other sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, malaria, autoimmune disorders, asthma, and allergies. Recently NIAID's resources and expertise have been increasingly applied to biodefense research via the study of disease-causing microbes. The proposed facilities would include intramural NIAID Biosafety Levels (BSL) 2, 3, and 4 laboratory and animal research units for the purpose of conducting NIAID biodefense and emerging infections research. The IRF facility would have a building footprint of 75,000 square feet and an adjoining parking lot covering 35,000 square feet. The building could provide as much as 150,000 gross square feet of floor space. Research at the Fort Detrick site would address pathogenesis, immune response, vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics, with a focus on gaining answers to clinical questions with broad public health implications. In particular, the NIAID IRF would address the need for increased BSL-4 capability, minimizing risk of exposure to potential hazardous agents for laboratory workers and the outside environment. In addition to the proposed action, this draft EIS considers a No Action Alternative. The consolidated federal government appropriations for fiscal year 2003 included $105 million to fund the project. POSITIVE IMPACTS: Research at the new facility would contribute to the development and improvement of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapies to protect civilians from biological agents used by domestic and international terrorists. The research would have important implications for medical approaches to all emerging infectious diseases. The facilities would complement NIAID's overall biodefense research program at other NIH and NIH-supported research sites. NEGATIVE IMPACTS: Facilities construction would require the clearance of small areas of forested land and the displacement of open recreational space. The site would be affected by the presence of potential sinkhole sites. The site would generate additional hazardous chemical and biological wastes to be treated at the fort.

Oncoming wave of collaboration: IE,"Companies are migrating away from the traditional manufacturing environment to one in which they act as designers and systems integrators, with the actual manufacturing being done by smaller companies. This creates a distributed, network-oriented virtual corporation of sorts. This scenario is already common in the defense industry, where much of the production is done by smaller firms in the supply chain. Strategists involved in the Technology Insertion Demonstration and Evaluation Program (TIDE) based at the Doyle Center for Manufacturing Technology in Pittsburgh have embarked on new research surrounding network-centric manufacturing. They are focusing on the collaboration processes, identifying contractor and supplier requirements to improve those processes, and developing improvements in collaborative tools and practices. TIDE is a research program to develop tools and techniques that will enable smaller manufacturing companies to participate fully in the supply chains of large original equipment manufacturers and prime contractors to the Department of Defense. During the course of TIDE's initial work, it became apparent that a significant change in the traditional manufacturing business model was taking place.",231433567,,,Trade Journals,,"Buhman, Charles H, Jr", IISOFB,, Copyright Institute of Industrial Engineers Aug 2003,,, Feature,, Aug 2003," Supply chain , Virtual business , Technology integration , Wave , Collaboration",,1542-894X,8.0, English, English,, 43, Norcross,Aug 2003,Industrial Engineer,2003,,35.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/oncoming-wave-collaboration/docview/231433567/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Oncoming+wave+of+collaboration%3A+IE&amp;title=Industrial+Engineer&amp;issn=1542894X&amp;date=2003-08-01&amp;volume=35&amp;issue=8&amp;spage=43&amp;au=Buhman%2C+Charles+H%2C+Jr&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Industrial+Engineer&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",company migrating away traditional manufacturing environment one act designer system integrator actual manufacturing done smaller company creates distributed virtual corporation sort scenario already common industry much production done smaller firm supply chain strategist involved technology insertion demonstration evaluation program tide based doyle center manufacturing technology pittsburgh embarked new surrounding manufacturing focusing collaboration process identifying contractor supplier requirement improve process developing improvement collaborative tool practice tide program develop tool technique enable smaller manufacturing company participate fully supply chain large original equipment manufacturer prime contractor course tide initial work became apparent significant change traditional manufacturing business model taking place,"['companies', 'migrating', 'away', 'traditional', 'manufacturing', 'environment', 'one', 'act', 'designers', 'systems', 'integrators', 'actual', 'manufacturing', 'done', 'smaller', 'companies', 'creates', 'distributed', 'virtual', 'corporation', 'sorts', 'scenario', 'already', 'common', 'industry', 'much', 'production', 'done', 'smaller', 'firms', 'supply', 'chain', 'strategists', 'involved', 'technology', 'insertion', 'demonstration', 'evaluation', 'program', 'tide', 'based', 'doyle', 'center', 'manufacturing', 'technology', 'pittsburgh', 'embarked', 'new', 'surrounding', 'manufacturing', 'focusing', 'collaboration', 'processes', 'identifying', 'contractor', 'supplier', 'requirements', 'improve', 'processes', 'developing', 'improvements', 'collaborative', 'tools', 'practices', 'tide', 'program', 'develop', 'tools', 'techniques', 'enable', 'smaller', 'manufacturing', 'companies', 'participate', 'fully', 'supply', 'chains', 'large', 'original', 'equipment', 'manufacturers', 'prime', 'contractors', 'course', 'tide', 'initial', 'work', 'became', 'apparent', 'significant', 'change', 'traditional', 'manufacturing', 'business', 'model', 'taking', 'place']",Feature,2,Process Improvement
Avondale adds to record take by contractor,"This July, Ship Systems will christen the first of its 12-ship LPD program, a multibillion-dollar U.S. Navy contract, [Ed Winter] said. The second ship is under construction at Avondale, the third at Pascagoula. The shipyard is winding down its U.S. Navy Sea Lift ship program, delivering the final 950-foot cargo carrier this summer. Avondale will also deliver the third of its 5 Polar Tanker ships to ConocoPhillips this year, Winter said. Avondale employs nearly 7,000 workers, making it one of the state's largest employers, said Trisha Hirth, workforce development coordinator for the Jefferson Parish Economic Development Commission, which assisted Avondale in its on-the-job training program.

Knowledge and work in context: A case of troubleshooting a complex system across ship and shore,"The implications of knowledge management present two key challenges to human performance technology. In short, the issues are these: (1)&#xa0;how to conceptualize knowledge and work distributed across organizational boundaries for purposes of analysis; and (2)&#xa0;how to target one or more levels of organization for performance intervention. In fact, what may be required in light of this dilemma is a focused reassessment of current theory and practice. Accordingly, to address the first issue a position is developed that proposes theories from which human performance technology conventionally draws, primarily behavioral psychology and cognitive information processing, are myopic in perspective. From the standpoint of these theories, knowledge is oft-conceptualized as an object , something which can be codified and transferred to enhance performance and learning. Continuing a line of thought advanced by like-minded scholars, I propose that knowledge might better be conceptualized as a process , emphasizing participation, activity, and meaning-making. Three alternative perspectives amendable to this view, communities of practice, activity theory , and institutional theory , are recruited to conduct this measured reconceptualization. Concerning the second issue, the assertion is that interventions tend to gravitate toward support of the individual absent organizational context. By contrast, the position I support maintains that attention to social and cultural features of organization is critical for any intervention proposed to improve performance. Consequently, to demonstrate how these challenges may be met, a case study portraying the distributed nature of knowledge and work among co-present and “virtual” teams is presented. The depiction of these teams, comprised of military and civilian technicians troubleshooting complex systems aboard U.S. Navy ships, is then analyzed and explained from the three alternative perspectives. To conclude, insights gained from the case study examination are used to inform the development of knowledge management strategies for intervention. In line with the direction of this study, solutions are formulated to account for social and cultural features of organization, i.e., context . Thus, the objective of this dissertation is to reveal two salient challenges to HPT and then demonstrate how they might be dealt with in theory and practice.",305334668,,,Dissertations &

Implications of lateral flow generation on land-surface scheme fluxes,"This thesis details the development and calibration of a model created by coupling a land surface simulation model named CLASS with a hydrologic model named WATFLOOD. The resulting model, known as WatCLASS, is able to serve as a lower boundary for an atmospheric model. In addition, WatCLASS can act independently of an atmospheric model to simulate fluxes of energy and moisture from the land surface, including streamflow. These flux outputs are generated based on conservation equations for both heat and moisture ensuring result continuity. WatCLASS has been tested over both the data rich BOREAS domains at fine scales and the large but data poor domain of the Mackenzie River at a coarse scale. The results, while encouraging, point to errors in the model physics related primarily to soil moisture transport in partially frozen soils and permafrost. By simulating streamflow and hence soil moisture over the land surface, hydrologic models, when properly enabled with both energy and water balance capabilities, can influence the apportioning of the relative quantities of latent and sensible heat flux that are required by atmospheric models. WatCLASS has shown that by improving streamflow simulations, evaporation amounts are reduced by approximately 70% (1271mm to 740mm) during a three year simulation period in the BOREAS northern old black spruce site (NSA-OBS) as compared to the use of CLASS alone. To create a model that can act both as a lower boundary for the atmosphere and a hydrologic model, two choices are available. This model can be constructed from scratch with all the caveats and problems associated with proving a new model and having it accepted by the atmospheric community. An alternate mechanism, more likely to be successfully implemented, was chosen for the development of WatCLASS. Here, two proven and well tested models, WATFLOOD and CLASS, were coupled in a phased integration strategy that allowed development to proceed on model components independently. The ultimate goal of this implementation strategy, a fully coupled atmospheric—land surface—hydrologic model, was developed for MC2-CLASS-WATFLOOD. Initial testing of this model, over the Saguenay region of Quebec, has yet to show that adding WATFLOOD to CLASS produces significant impacts on atmospheric simulation. It is suspected, that this is due to the short term nature of the weather simulation that is dominated by initial conditions imposed on the atmospheric model during the data assimilation cycle. To model the hydrologic system, using the domain of an atmospheric model, requires that methods be developed to characterize land surface forms that influence hydrologic response. Methods, such as GRU (Grouped Response Unit) developed for WATFLOOD, need to be extended to taken advantage of alternate data forms, such as soil and topography, in a way that allows parameters to be selected a priori . Use of GIS (Geographical Information System) and large data bases to assist in development of these relationships has been started here.

"GREERS FERRY LAKE SHORELINE MANAGEMENT PLAN, VAN BUREN, CLEBURNE, SCARCY, WHITE, INDEPENDENCE, AND POPE COUNTIES, ARKANSAS. [Part 7 of 8]","PURPOSE: The implementation of a revised shoreline management plan (SMP) for Greers Ferry Lake, Van Buren, Cleburne, Scarcy, White, Independence, and Pope counties, Arkansas is proposed. The current SMP was initiated in 1994. The 45,548-acre Greers Ferry Lake Project area, which includes the 31,500-acre lake, lies in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains in north-central Arkansas approximately 65 miles from Little Rock, Arkansas and 130 miles from Memphis, Tennessee. This final EIS responds to a U.S. District Court order requiring that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rescind its 2000 FMP and develop alternative SMPs for consideration. Key issues identified during scoping include those related to zoning of limited development areas, vegetation modification, provisions for grandfathered docks, and restrictions on boats with sleeping quarters and/or marine sanitation devices. These elements were combined in various formulations to develop the alternatives considered in the EIS. The EIS considers six alternatives, including a No Action Alternative (Alternative 1). The preferred alternative (Alternative 6) would increase the shoreline zoned for limited development, approving 56 rezoning requests, including 41 of the rezoning requests that met 90 percent of the rezoning criteria. Four of the requests that originally met the 90 percent criteria would not be approved based on two additional elimination criteria. Two boat dock rezoning requests in the Narrows, a heavily used area, would be denied along lakeshore areas that would be designated as very high scenic integrity protection areas; three areas of the lake would receive this designation. Grandfathered boat docks in these protected areas would not be removed and improvements to them would be allowed. To be equitable to those individuals whose docks were permitted at the time of approval of the 2000 management plan, 15 of the 16 permits that did not meet the 90 percent rezoning criteria but which did meet the 80 percent criteria would be conditionally approved. POSITIVE IMPACTS: The plan would provide long-term recreational benefits as well as long-term benefits to soils and geologic resources and ecological systems and short-term socioeconomic benefits to the local community. NEGATIVE IMPACTS: Cultural resources could suffer damage due to developments allowed under the plan. Water and soil quality degradation, including degradation as a result of hazardous materials and other wastes, would occur. Noise levels would increase somewhat, and new structures would impact visual aesthetics. LEGAL MANDATES: Flood Control Act of 1938 (P.L. 75-761) and Flood Control Act of 1944 (P.L. 78-534).

A definition of high-level decisions in the engineering of systems,"The role of the systems engineer defines that he or she be proactive and guide the program manager and their customers through their decisions to enhance the effectiveness of system development—producing faster, better, and cheaper systems. The present lack of coverage in literature on what these decisions are and how they relate to each other may be a contributing factor to the high rate of failure among system projects. At the onset of the system development process, decisions have an integral role in the design of a system that meets stakeholders' needs. This is apparent during the design and qualification of both the Development System and the Operational System. The performance, cost and schedule of the Development System affect the performance of the Operational System and are affected by decisions that influence physical elements of the Development System. The performance, cost, and schedule of the Operational System is affected by decisions that influence physical elements of the Operational System. Traditionally, product and process have been designed using know-how and trial and error. However, the empiricism of engineers and program managers is limited which can, and has led to costly mistakes. To date, very little research has explored decisions made in the engineering of a system. In government, literature exists on procurement processes for major system development; but in general literature on decisions, how they relate to each other, and the key information requirements within one of two systems and across the two systems is not readily available. This research hopes to improve the processes inherent in the engineering of systems. The primary focus of this research is on department of defense (DoD) military systems, specifically aerospace systems and may generalize more broadly. The result of this research is a process tool, a Decision System Model, which can be used by systems engineers to guide the program manager and their customers through the decisions about concurrently designing and qualifying both the Development and Operational systems.",305484467,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Powell, Robert Anthony",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2002," Applied sciences , Decision-making , Department of Defense , Systems engineering", 978-0-493-64655-8,,, English, English,,,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/definition-high-level-decisions-engineering/docview/305484467/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+definition+of+high-level+decisions+in+the+engineering+of+systems&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Powell%2C+Robert+Anthony&amp;isbn=978-0-493-64655-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,role system engineer defines proactive guide program manager customer decision enhance effectiveness system faster better cheaper system present lack coverage literature decision relate may contributing factor high rate failure among system project onset system development process decision integral role design system meet stakeholder need apparent design qualification development system operational system performance cost schedule development system affect performance operational system affected decision influence physical element development system performance cost schedule operational system affected decision influence physical element operational system traditionally product process designed using trial error however empiricism engineer program manager limited led costly mistake date little explored decision made engineering system government literature exists procurement process major system development general literature decision relate key information requirement within one two system across two system readily available hope improve process inherent engineering system primary focus system specifically aerospace system may generalize broadly process tool decision system model used system engineer guide program manager customer decision concurrently designing qualifying development operational system,"['role', 'systems', 'engineer', 'defines', 'proactive', 'guide', 'program', 'manager', 'customers', 'decisions', 'enhance', 'effectiveness', 'system', 'faster', 'better', 'cheaper', 'systems', 'present', 'lack', 'coverage', 'literature', 'decisions', 'relate', 'may', 'contributing', 'factor', 'high', 'rate', 'failure', 'among', 'system', 'projects', 'onset', 'system', 'development', 'process', 'decisions', 'integral', 'role', 'design', 'system', 'meets', 'stakeholders', 'needs', 'apparent', 'design', 'qualification', 'development', 'system', 'operational', 'system', 'performance', 'cost', 'schedule', 'development', 'system', 'affect', 'performance', 'operational', 'system', 'affected', 'decisions', 'influence', 'physical', 'elements', 'development', 'system', 'performance', 'cost', 'schedule', 'operational', 'system', 'affected', 'decisions', 'influence', 'physical', 'elements', 'operational', 'system', 'traditionally', 'product', 'process', 'designed', 'using', 'trial', 'error', 'however', 'empiricism', 'engineers', 'program', 'managers', 'limited', 'led', 'costly', 'mistakes', 'date', 'little', 'explored', 'decisions', 'made', 'engineering', 'system', 'government', 'literature', 'exists', 'procurement', 'processes', 'major', 'system', 'development', 'general', 'literature', 'decisions', 'relate', 'key', 'information', 'requirements', 'within', 'one', 'two', 'systems', 'across', 'two', 'systems', 'readily', 'available', 'hopes', 'improve', 'processes', 'inherent', 'engineering', 'systems', 'primary', 'focus', 'systems', 'specifically', 'aerospace', 'systems', 'may', 'generalize', 'broadly', 'result', 'process', 'tool', 'decision', 'system', 'model', 'used', 'systems', 'engineers', 'guide', 'program', 'manager', 'customers', 'decisions', 'concurrently', 'designing', 'qualifying', 'development', 'operational', 'systems']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
Robust requirements traceability for handling evolutionary and speculative change,"Requirements traceability is crucial to the successful development and management of all non-trivial software systems. This is illustrated by the fact that the U.S. Department of Defense invests about four percent of its total information technology budget on traceability issues. Unfortunately, despite its importance, practitioners frequently fail to implement and maintain adequate traceability schemes. In their 1999 report, the Standish group revealed that in the previous year overruns and failed projects cost U.S. companies a staggering ninety-seven billion dollars! Several researchers have demonstrated that inadequate traceability is a major contributing factor in such project over-runs, and that its failure limits their ability to manage change effectively. Many factors contribute to this failure; however, one of the major causes is the complexity and sheer number of relationships that must be considered, and the subsequent failure of time-pressured developers to consistently update links and artifacts as requirements are changed. This failure results in the gradual erosion of the traceability infrastructure until it can no longer adequately support change management. This thesis addresses the problem by proposing a new method of traceability based upon event-notification. Traceable objects are no longer tightly coupled, but are linked through an event service, which creates an environment in which change is handled more efficiently. By using event logs, accurate traceability links can be reconstructed throughout the life of the system as needed. The proposed method not only handles long-term evolutionary change, but also supports temporary speculative change that enables “what-if” types of query. Posing these questions about a software system is an important yet often unsupported activity. Current impact analysis techniques tend to focus upon the functionality of the system, whilst the effects of change upon performance requirements are often ignored until after implementation. This tendency can lead to costly and time-consuming mistakes. By establishing dynamic links, capable of propagating data values and commands between requirements and performance models, it becomes possible to automate a wide range of speculative queries and to enhance the overall ability to predict the impact of change upon the performance of the system.",276435120,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Huang, Jane",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Radar image studies of scattering from random rough surfaces,"Wave scattering from randomly rough surfaces is of interest in many electromagnetic applications. The recent development of efficient analytical and numerical models allows new insights into electromagnetic scattering from rough surfaces. However, the detailed scattering behaviors have not well understood even from the analytical models. Radar imaging techniques as more descriptive approaches offer a unique tool for better understanding of rough surface scattering phenomena. In this dissertation existing rough surface scattering theories are investigated through analysis of radar images. The approximate theories include the physical optics (PO) approximation, the small perturbation method (SPM) and the local/non-local small slope approximations (SSA/NLSSA). Numerical results are obtained from an accelerated method of moments based on a forward-backward iterative algorithm (MoM-FB/NSA). Back-projection tomography is applied to form synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Backscatter results at X-band are considered for deterministic one-dimensional random rough surfaces. Surfaces with Gaussian and Pierson-Moskowitz spectra are examined first. Radar images from numerical models are compared with those obtained from approximate scattering theories to discern differences in the resulting scattering mechanisms. A simple ray tracing algorithm is applied to analyze possible multiple scattering effects observed in the image domain. For ocean-like surfaces described by P-M spectrum, images at high incident angles show strong backscatter contributions from the “Bragg” components of the surface and the long-wave “tilting” effects. Several simulated time-evolving breaking waves are investigated to study the “super-event” or “sea spike” phenomena. A radar image study reveals the significant multipath scattering effects. A “four-path” model is incorporated into the analysis of these effects. Scattering from a layered medium bounded by a rough interface is also investigated. The scattering formulation is derived based on the small slope theory which accounts for interactions between a rough interface and target layers. Radar images are examined to show the effects of the presence of sublayers. Finally, two-dimensional rough surface scattering problems and the associated three-dimensional radar imaging algorithm are addressed. A modified expression of SAR image formation is provided. The PO backscatter results are considered for image construction.

Real-time targeting: Myth or reality?,"Owing to the foresight of Rear Admiral Dennis Vaughan, U.S, Navy (Retired), the Navy developed the Littoral Surveillance System (LSS) based on the engine that drives the Army's Tactical Exploitation System (TES). It is ironic that LSS was conceived in the less heady atmosphere of the Director of Naval Reserve at the office of the Chief of Naval Operations, not the mainline corridors of the staff.

"Swamped With Commercial Business, GD Pauses to Ensure DoD Satisfaction","""Right now, the commercial world is opportunity-rich for us and we have more business coming in over the transom than we can really handle, so we are having to be selective and careful not to over- commit ourselves because our first mission and our first priority is to serve our military customers,"" Nick Chabraja, GD's chairman and CEO, told sister publication Defense Daily International recently during a wide-ranging interview here. ""We don't lose focus of that. I mean, we're all about earning money, but we don't forget our obligations to our core customer, the United States."" The businesses form the core of GD's $2.3 billion Information Systems and Technology Group that is the company's fastest-growing unit, having seen its sales jump more than 170 percent over the past year. While only 15 percent of the unit's annual revenues are non- military, Chabraja said he wants to increase GD's commercial opportunities--particularly in information technology--but not at the expense of winning defense contracts and staying on the Pentagon's good side. For example, while commercial work provides GD with access to cutting- edge technologies and can be lucrative, the vast majority of the company's revenues are generated through defense orders. One major defense contract being sought by the new information technology unit is the up to $10 billion award to furnish the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps with a new intranet system. GD is leading one of four teams vying for the contract, including EDS (EDS), Computing Sciences Corp. (CSC) and IBM (IBM).

GD is leading one of four teams vying for the contract, including EDS (EDS), Computing Sciences Corp. (CSC) and IBM (IBM). According to [Nick Chabraja], a major factor in GD's financial success has been its track record of performance that has held the company in good stead with its military customers, specifically the U.S. Navy and Army. While other leading defense firms, such as Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTNA/RTNB), have experienced program performance problems in the wake of breakneck merger and acquisition activity, GD has not. GD's diverse range of businesses--from destroyer and nuclear submarine production to tank and business jet manufacture--are so well integrated that Chabraja said he does not consider Bath, which was purchased for $300 million from Prudential in 1995, as a recent acquisition, but a legacy business that operates as a fundamental part of the corporation.",217292738,,,Trade Journals,,,, General Dynamics Corp," Copyright Phillips Business Information Corporation May 5, 2000",,, PERIODICAL,," May 5, 2000"," Second Industrial Revolution , Industrial internet of things , Fourth Industrial Revolution",,1529-4250,5.0, English, English,, 1, Potomac,"May 5, 2000",Defense Daily International,2000,,1.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/swamped-with-commercial-business-gd-pauses-ensure/docview/217292738/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabitrade&amp;atitle=Swamped+With+Commercial+Business%2C+GD+Pauses+to+Ensure+DoD+Satisfaction&amp;title=Defense+Daily+International&amp;issn=15294250&amp;date=2000-05-05&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=1&amp;au=&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Defense+Daily+International&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",example commercial work affords access edge technology lucrative vast majority company revenue generated order one major contract sought new information technology unit billion award furnish navy marine corp new intranet system leading one four team vying contract including ed ed computing science csc ibm ibm according nick chabraja major factor financial success track record performance held company good stead customer specifically navy army leading firm lockheed martin lmt raytheon experienced program performance problem wake breakneck merger acquisition activity diverse range business destroyer nuclear submarine production tank business jet manufacture well integrated chabraja said consider bath purchased million prudential recent acquisition legacy business operates fundamental part corporation,"['example', 'commercial', 'work', 'affords', 'access', 'edge', 'technologies', 'lucrative', 'vast', 'majority', 'company', 'revenues', 'generated', 'orders', 'one', 'major', 'contract', 'sought', 'new', 'information', 'technology', 'unit', 'billion', 'award', 'furnish', 'navy', 'marine', 'corps', 'new', 'intranet', 'system', 'leading', 'one', 'four', 'teams', 'vying', 'contract', 'including', 'eds', 'eds', 'computing', 'sciences', 'csc', 'ibm', 'ibm', 'according', 'nick', 'chabraja', 'major', 'factor', 'financial', 'success', 'track', 'record', 'performance', 'held', 'company', 'good', 'stead', 'customers', 'specifically', 'navy', 'army', 'leading', 'firms', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'lmt', 'raytheon', 'experienced', 'program', 'performance', 'problems', 'wake', 'breakneck', 'merger', 'acquisition', 'activity', 'diverse', 'range', 'businesses', 'destroyer', 'nuclear', 'submarine', 'production', 'tank', 'business', 'jet', 'manufacture', 'well', 'integrated', 'chabraja', 'said', 'consider', 'bath', 'purchased', 'million', 'prudential', 'recent', 'acquisition', 'legacy', 'business', 'operates', 'fundamental', 'part', 'corporation']",PERIODICAL,2,Management and Leadership
Effects of Department of Defense acquisition reform on military software development programs,"A study of the effects of Department of Defense regulation and standardization on military software development programs including recent attempts to decrease these levels of regulation and standardization was presented. This study analyzed how the Department of Defense, in reaction to chaotic early military procurement, directed the entire development process for computer hardware, firmware, and software, including precisely defining what computing equipment and software was to be developed, how it was to be developed, tested, and documented, and how it was to be maintained after deployment. This study attempted to determine if the recent Department of Defense directives requiring the use of off-the-shelf software whenever practical and the cancellation of hundreds of Military Standards and Military Specifications was a wise and prudent course of action in an attempt to expedite software development schedules, lower software development costs and hasten the incorporation of rapidly evolving commercial software. This study explored the potential benefits and detriments of off-the-shelf software based on how well it satisfies and promotes configuration management, portability, humancomputer interface, security, reliability, maintainability, testability, warranty, guarantee, documentation, validation, and verification through all phases of the software life-cycle.",304680900,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Martin, Bruce Leonard",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2000," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Acquisition reform , Department of Defense , Military , Software", 978-0-599-81297-0,,, English, English,,,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-department-defense-acquisition-reform-on/docview/304680900/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Effects+of+Department+of+Defense+acquisition+reform+on+military+software+development+programs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Martin%2C+Bruce+Leonard&amp;isbn=978-0-599-81297-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,effect regulation standardization software development program including recent attempt decrease level regulation standardization presented analyzed reaction chaotic early procurement directed entire development process computer hardware firmware software including precisely defining computing equipment software developed developed tested documented maintained deployment attempted determine recent directive requiring use software whenever practical cancellation hundred standard specification wise prudent course action attempt expedite software development schedule lower software development cost hasten incorporation rapidly evolving commercial software explored potential benefit detriment software based well satisfies promotes configuration management portability humancomputer interface security reliability maintainability testability warranty guarantee documentation validation verification phase software,"['effects', 'regulation', 'standardization', 'software', 'development', 'programs', 'including', 'recent', 'attempts', 'decrease', 'levels', 'regulation', 'standardization', 'presented', 'analyzed', 'reaction', 'chaotic', 'early', 'procurement', 'directed', 'entire', 'development', 'process', 'computer', 'hardware', 'firmware', 'software', 'including', 'precisely', 'defining', 'computing', 'equipment', 'software', 'developed', 'developed', 'tested', 'documented', 'maintained', 'deployment', 'attempted', 'determine', 'recent', 'directives', 'requiring', 'use', 'software', 'whenever', 'practical', 'cancellation', 'hundreds', 'standards', 'specifications', 'wise', 'prudent', 'course', 'action', 'attempt', 'expedite', 'software', 'development', 'schedules', 'lower', 'software', 'development', 'costs', 'hasten', 'incorporation', 'rapidly', 'evolving', 'commercial', 'software', 'explored', 'potential', 'benefits', 'detriments', 'software', 'based', 'well', 'satisfies', 'promotes', 'configuration', 'management', 'portability', 'humancomputer', 'interface', 'security', 'reliability', 'maintainability', 'testability', 'warranty', 'guarantee', 'documentation', 'validation', 'verification', 'phases', 'software']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Management and Leadership
Applications of the novel spectral acceleration (NSA) algorithm for the computation of scattering from rough surfaces,"Rough surface scattering plays an important role in many electromagnetic (EM) applications. Analytical theories exist and are limited in their regimes of validity. At present, scattering from surfaces whose properties render the analytical theories invalid can be accurately calculated only through the use of numerical methods. However, numerical scattering models for rough surfaces are usually computationally expensive for general use in most practical applications. In this dissertation, an extremely efficient and accurate iterative method of moments based on a novel spectral acceleration (NSA) algorithm is developed for the computation of scattering from both one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) large-scale rough surfaces corresponding to 2-D and 3-D vector wave problems, respectively. For fixed frequency and surface roughness statistics, it is shown that the computational cost and memory storage requirement of the NSA algorithm is [special characters omitted]( N tot ) as the surface size increases, where N tot is the total number of unknowns to be solved. The contribution of this dissertation can be summarized as follows: (1)&#xa0;The original 1-D NSA algorithm has been generalized for the fast computation of radiation/scattering from 1-D extremely large-scale quasi-planar structures (QPS). New analytical formulas associated with the 1-D NSA parameters are also derived, resulting in more flexibility in optimizing the 1-D NSA algorithm. In addition, the “multilevel” concept is introduced to improve the accuracy of the original NSA algorithm in the case of 1-D extremely large-scale QPS. (2)&#xa0;The 1-D NSA algorithm is extended to treat 2-D random rough surfaces, and the new 2-D NSA algorithm for these surfaces is derived. Appropriate spectral integral representations of the 3-D free space scalar Green's function and the “multilevel” algorithm are developed to efficiently compute scattered fields from extremely large-scale surfaces with relatively large surface cross-range size. (3)&#xa0;Numerical studies of the backscattering enhancement phenomenon for both 1-D and 2-D random rough surfaces are performed by varying the following parameters: surface statistics, surface material, polarization, and incident angle. It is found that the backscattering enhancement strongly depends on the above parameters. Physical insight gained from numerical results can potentially aid in the development and assessment of future extended analytical theories.",304610667,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Torrungrueng,

Methods for modeling team performance: A case study using a decision support system,"As a tool for process analysis, a procedure was developed to model and relate team in-process performance to the end-product while taking into account the human interactions of a team, and the variability of subject-matter-expert judgment. This was accomplished by combining a modified Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with either a Multi-Variant Linear Regression (MVLR) or an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Using the data obtained from a decision support system experiment with the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Officer Advanced Course students, a case study was used to develop a procedure for using the identified methods. Although the findings yielded little statistical difference in modeling performance of MVLR and ANN, the utility of such models was successfully used as a tool by helping to distinguish the characteristics and methods exhibited by the high performance versus the low performance teams.",230743207,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Baylot, Erwin Alexis, Jr.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 2000," Social sciences , Psychology , Applied sciences , A , CASE , DECISION , METHODS , MODELING , PERFORMANCE , STUDY , SUPPORT , SYSTEM , TEAM , USING", 978-0-599-75417-1,,, English, English,,,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/methods-modeling-team-performance-case-study/docview/230743207/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Methods+for+modeling+team+performance%3A+A+case+study+using+a+decision+support+system&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Baylot%2C+Erwin+Alexis%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=978-0-599-75417-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,tool process procedure developed model relate team performance taking account human interaction team variability judgment accomplished combining modified analytical hierarchy process ahp either linear regression mvlr artificial neural network ann using obtained decision support system experiment army intelligence officer advanced course student case used develop procedure using identified method although finding yielded little statistical difference modeling performance mvlr ann utility model successfully used tool helping distinguish characteristic method exhibited high performance versus low performance team,"['tool', 'process', 'procedure', 'developed', 'model', 'relate', 'team', 'performance', 'taking', 'account', 'human', 'interactions', 'team', 'variability', 'judgment', 'accomplished', 'combining', 'modified', 'analytical', 'hierarchy', 'process', 'ahp', 'either', 'linear', 'regression', 'mvlr', 'artificial', 'neural', 'network', 'ann', 'using', 'data', 'obtained', 'decision', 'support', 'system', 'experiment', 'army', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'advanced', 'course', 'students', 'case', 'used', 'develop', 'procedure', 'using', 'identified', 'methods', 'although', 'findings', 'yielded', 'little', 'statistical', 'difference', 'modeling', 'performance', 'mvlr', 'ann', 'utility', 'models', 'successfully', 'used', 'tool', 'helping', 'distinguish', 'characteristics', 'methods', 'exhibited', 'high', 'performance', 'versus', 'low', 'performance', 'teams']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement

A study of hospital information systems implementation problems and suggested solutions,"The introduction and utilization of information systems in the hospital environment has had a significant and lasting impact on the practice of medicine. The process of introducing hospital information systems to the environment has influenced the effectiveness of the implementation and their use. Utilizing a four part questionnaire, this thesis involved the distribution of 4,280 copies of the instrument to healthcare providers located at six medium size community hospitals operated by the U.S. Navy; 912 participants responded, including 74 physicians, 197 nurses, and 641 other categories of healthcare providers and administrators. A correlation analysis was conducted to indicate significant trends in the responses received. The wide distribution and high numbers of respondents provided a valid basis for the analysis being conducted. Clearly, the single, overarching message developed from the evaluation of the data was the importance of information technology training for all members of the hospital staff. The opinions of the respondents varied with respect to timing, method of delivery, and extent of this training, however, at the hospitals surveyed, there was a universal agreement on the value of training and that it was an influencing factor on the degree of initial acceptance of information systems. Drawing upon the results of the survey and data evaluation, two courses of study were developed; these were designed for inclusion in local community college information systems curricula. These courses, offered concurrently at a local community college, could effectively be used to prepare a Navy hospital for implementation of a major information system. With some modification, the Navy Medical Information Department Director course can be utilized, in conjunction with the introductory information technology course, to prepare any hospital for the implementation of a major information system.",304504461,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Hudock, Steven A.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 1998," Health and environmental sciences , Communication and the arts", 978-0-591-84459-7,,, English, English,,,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/study-hospital-information-systems-implementation/docview/304504461/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+of+hospital+information+systems+implementation+problems+and+suggested+solutions&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hudock%2C+Steven+A.&amp;isbn=978-0-591-84459-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Health Research Premium Collection, ProQuest One Academic",introduction utilization information system hospital environment significant lasting impact practice medicine process introducing hospital information system environment influenced effectiveness implementation use utilizing four part questionnaire involved distribution copy instrument healthcare provider located six medium size community hospital operated navy participant responded including physician nurse category healthcare provider administrator correlation conducted indicate significant trend response received wide distribution high number respondent provided valid basis conducted clearly single overarching message developed evaluation importance information technology training member hospital staff opinion respondent varied respect timing delivery extent training however hospital surveyed universal agreement value training influencing factor degree initial acceptance information system drawing upon result survey evaluation two course developed designed inclusion local community college information system curriculum course offered concurrently local community college could effectively used prepare navy hospital implementation major information system modification navy medical information director course utilized conjunction introductory information technology course prepare hospital implementation major information system,"['introduction', 'utilization', 'information', 'systems', 'hospital', 'environment', 'significant', 'lasting', 'impact', 'practice', 'medicine', 'process', 'introducing', 'hospital', 'information', 'systems', 'environment', 'influenced', 'effectiveness', 'implementation', 'use', 'utilizing', 'four', 'part', 'questionnaire', 'thesis', 'involved', 'distribution', 'copies', 'instrument', 'healthcare', 'providers', 'located', 'six', 'medium', 'size', 'community', 'hospitals', 'operated', 'navy', 'participants', 'responded', 'including', 'physicians', 'nurses', 'categories', 'healthcare', 'providers', 'administrators', 'correlation', 'conducted', 'indicate', 'significant', 'trends', 'responses', 'received', 'wide', 'distribution', 'high', 'numbers', 'respondents', 'provided', 'valid', 'basis', 'conducted', 'clearly', 'single', 'overarching', 'message', 'developed', 'evaluation', 'data', 'importance', 'information', 'technology', 'training', 'members', 'hospital', 'staff', 'opinions', 'respondents', 'varied', 'respect', 'timing', 'delivery', 'extent', 'training', 'however', 'hospitals', 'surveyed', 'universal', 'agreement', 'value', 'training', 'influencing', 'factor', 'degree', 'initial', 'acceptance', 'information', 'systems', 'drawing', 'upon', 'results', 'survey', 'data', 'evaluation', 'two', 'courses', 'developed', 'designed', 'inclusion', 'local', 'community', 'college', 'information', 'systems', 'curricula', 'courses', 'offered', 'concurrently', 'local', 'community', 'college', 'could', 'effectively', 'used', 'prepare', 'navy', 'hospital', 'implementation', 'major', 'information', 'system', 'modification', 'navy', 'medical', 'information', 'director', 'course', 'utilized', 'conjunction', 'introductory', 'information', 'technology', 'course', 'prepare', 'hospital', 'implementation', 'major', 'information', 'system']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Process Improvement
The development and use of a process identification model to aid in business process reengineering efforts,"The purpose of this dissertation is to report on research into the area business process reengineering (BPR). Primarily, its focus is on the development and validation of a Process Identification Model (PIM) based on a tailoring of the Software Engineering Institute's Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Model. Additionally, this dissertation demonstrates how the PIM may fit into classical BPR efforts and methodologies. This PIM will not change the nature of BPR. BPR, by definition, is a rethinking of a business' value adding processes. However, the PIM will reduce the effort taken by an organization to identify and prioritize critical business processes which need to be reengineered. In this sense, effort is defined as a combination of the time taken and the organizational level of personnel required to identify the critical processes. BPR was introduced to the management world through the work of Michael Hammer and James Champy in their 1993 book, Reengineering the Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution. According to Hammer and Champy, businesses must be capable of rapidly changing processes if they are going to remain competitive. In their book, Hammer and Champy define reengineering as, ""... the fundamental rethinking and redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical contemporary measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed."" However, they also state that, ""... the method used to decide among reengineering opportunities is not a formal one."" If change is so urgent and necessary for continued existence, is not a formal methodology for identifying reengineering opportunities a critical piece of the plan? Since its introduction in 1993, BPR has undergone a lot of criticism. Some of the criticism has centered around the identification of critical processes. Some of the criticism has centered around the impact to employees and the unfeasibility of a ""clean slate approach"" to conducting BPR. Additionally, criticisms of BPR's ""top down"" approach, through the use of senior leaders, managers, and process owners, seems to have ignored the knowledge and experience available from the process executors--the workers. This dissertation analyzes the criticisms of BPR and develops a process identification model to help managers focus resources on critical processes for reengineering. This PIM is validated through the use of case and control groups. These groups were drawn from a Department of Defense (DoD) organization undergoing an organizational transformation effort where identification of critical processes for reengineering was a key piece of the transformation plan. The control group is the senior management team of the organization. This group, with the aid of consultants, executed a conventional program for process identification and reengineering. The case group was randomly drawn from the DoD military and civilian work-force and the DoD support contractors. Using a non-parametric statistical analysis, it is shown that the effort required to identify critical processes using the PIM is statistically less than the effort required in conventional reengineering. Additionally, the PIM is qualitatively validated through a comparison of the processes identified by the case and control group and through an assessment by the senior management team. In its conclusion, the dissertation argues that the model developed through the use of a government organization is transferable to other organizations (civilian or government) which seek to focus resources on key processes which need to be reengineered.",304504101,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Moles, Joseph Bruce",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the

Quality Air Force: One squadron's struggle with TQM,"In 1988, the United States Air Force created the Quality Air Force program based on management techniques developed through TQM. This attempt by the Department of Defense to better manage its streamlined forces produced varying effects among squadrons across the nation. The 962 Airborne Air Control Squadron experienced many trials and tribulations with the implementation of the program and eventually turned away from its quality techniques due to the many obstacles encountered in applying a business oriented managerial approach to a military operation. Members of the squadron were surveyed in order to gain insight into the activities of managers at the squadron level in this quality environment. The strengths and weaknesses associated with the application of quality initiatives along with the resulting tabulation of the questionnaire offer a look into how the military developed a quality environment within an organization that depends solely on its leaders.",304489754,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Longino, D'Ron",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 1998," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Total Quality Management", 978-0-599-00420-7,,, English, English,,,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/quality-air-force-one-squadrons-struggle-with-tqm/docview/304489754/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Quality+Air+Force%3A+One+squadron%27s+struggle+with+TQM&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Longino%2C+D%27Ron&amp;isbn=978-0-599-00420-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,united state air force created quality air force program based management technique developed tqm attempt better manage streamlined force produced varying effect among squadron across nation airborne air control squadron experienced many trial tribulation implementation program eventually turned away quality technique due many obstacle encountered applying business oriented managerial operation member squadron surveyed order gain insight activity manager squadron level quality environment strength weakness associated application quality initiative along resulting tabulation questionnaire offer look developed quality environment within organization depends solely leader,"['united', 'states', 'air', 'force', 'created', 'quality', 'air', 'force', 'program', 'based', 'management', 'techniques', 'developed', 'tqm', 'attempt', 'better', 'manage', 'streamlined', 'forces', 'produced', 'varying', 'effects', 'among', 'squadrons', 'across', 'nation', 'airborne', 'air', 'control', 'squadron', 'experienced', 'many', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'implementation', 'program', 'eventually', 'turned', 'away', 'quality', 'techniques', 'due', 'many', 'obstacles', 'encountered', 'applying', 'business', 'oriented', 'managerial', 'operation', 'members', 'squadron', 'surveyed', 'order', 'gain', 'insight', 'activities', 'managers', 'squadron', 'level', 'quality', 'environment', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'associated', 'application', 'quality', 'initiatives', 'along', 'resulting', 'tabulation', 'questionnaire', 'offer', 'look', 'developed', 'quality', 'environment', 'within', 'organization', 'depends', 'solely', 'leaders']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
"Responses to the Quality Mandate by the Non-Commissioned Officers at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii","The purpose of this case study was to determine the responses to the quality mandate by the Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) ranks at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii. The impetus for this study was the mandate by the Department of Defense that quality management techniques be implemented throughout the armed services, where resistance to quality programs within the armed services exists. In order to answer the question, questionnaires, focus groups, and interviews were used to determine the responses of the Non-Commissioned Officers Academy Class 97-3 located at Hickam Air Force Base. The class consisted of 34 NCOs in the grade of Technical Sergeant. The study revealed several impediments to the execution of the quality movement, including deficiencies in academic training of NCOs, poor acceptance by mid-level officer and senior NCO leadership, and constraints on base personnel time for training and implementation. The study showed that increased emphasis by senior Air Force leadership in these three areas would help NCOs more widely embrace this quality form of management.",304468007,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Brown, Bruce Alan",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 1998," Social sciences , Education , Hawaii , Hickam Air Force Base , Military , Non-Commissioned Officers , Quality , United States Air Force , NCO", 978-0-599-08590-9,,, English, English,,,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/responses-quality-mandate-non-commissioned/docview/304468007/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Responses+to+the+Quality+Mandate+by+the+Non-Commissioned+Officers+at+Hickam+Air+Force+Base%2C+Hawaii&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brown%2C+Bruce+Alan&amp;isbn=978-0-599-08590-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,purpose case determine response quality mandate officer nco rank hickam air force base hawaii impetus mandate quality management technique implemented throughout armed service resistance quality program within armed service exists order answer question questionnaire focus group interview used determine response officer academy class located hickam air force base class consisted ncos grade technical sergeant revealed several impediment execution quality movement including deficiency academic training ncos poor acceptance officer senior nco leadership constraint base personnel time training implementation showed increased emphasis senior air force leadership three area would help ncos widely embrace quality form management,"['purpose', 'case', 'determine', 'responses', 'quality', 'mandate', 'officer', 'nco', 'ranks', 'hickam', 'air', 'force', 'base', 'hawaii', 'impetus', 'mandate', 'quality', 'management', 'techniques', 'implemented', 'throughout', 'armed', 'services', 'resistance', 'quality', 'programs', 'within', 'armed', 'services', 'exists', 'order', 'answer', 'question', 'questionnaires', 'focus', 'groups', 'interviews', 'used', 'determine', 'responses', 'officers', 'academy', 'class', 'located', 'hickam', 'air', 'force', 'base', 'class', 'consisted', 'ncos', 'grade', 'technical', 'sergeant', 'revealed', 'several', 'impediments', 'execution', 'quality', 'movement', 'including', 'deficiencies', 'academic', 'training', 'ncos', 'poor', 'acceptance', 'officer', 'senior', 'nco', 'leadership', 'constraints', 'base', 'personnel', 'time', 'training', 'implementation', 'showed', 'increased', 'emphasis', 'senior', 'air', 'force', 'leadership', 'three', 'areas', 'would', 'help', 'ncos', 'widely', 'embrace', 'quality', 'form', 'management']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Investigation of the use of viscoelastic damping devices to rehabilitate a lightly reinforced concrete slab-column structure,"The objective of this study was to develop improved understanding of the seismic behavior of a lightly reinforced concrete (LRC) slab-column structure that was modified by the addition of viscoelastic dampers (VEDs). The study includes both experimental and analytical phases. The feasibility of using VEDs to rehabilitate existing LRC slab-column structures was explored, and implications for structural design were considered. The experimental phase of the study involved fabricating and testing a model of a section of a three-story military barracks building that was constructed in the mid-1950's. The barracks is a two-bay LRC slab-column frame. The model was constructed at approximately one-third of full-scale. Material properties in the model emulated those of the prototype. Model reinforcement details paralleled prototype details. A rehabilitation scheme using VEDs was designed and implemented. VEDs were mounted in diagonal braces that extended between column lines in the model. The model was subjected to a series of earthquake simulations on the shaking table at the U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (USACERL). Experimental measurements included floor and VED displacements, floor accelerations, VED forces, and reinforcement strains. This report describes the design and construction of the model, the testing program, and the data obtained during the testing. Discussion and interpretation of the data follows the data descriptions. The earthquake simulations while VEDs were installed on the model were a series of gradually increasing intensity replications of two commonly used earthquake records. Simulation intensities were increased until the displacement limits of the shaking table actuators were reached. After that, the VEDs were removed, and a second series of simulations with the bare frame was conducted. Interpretations of the testing results are provided through the use of linear models of the type that might be used in the design office. The analytical models were used to assess strength, stiffness, and serviceability of the structure. In addition, the analytical models were used to assess the applicability of the linear modeling procedures that have been recommended in Federal Emergency Management Agency document 273, NEHRP Guidelines for the Seismic Rehabilitation of Buildings .",304446102,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Hayes, John Rives, Jr.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

COTS--uprating and the government contractor defense,"Recently Congress has encouraged agencies to adopt commercial-like procurement practices and to utilize more commercial items. In response, the Department of Defense has revised its acquisition procedures to reflect commercial practices. The government contractor defense historically has protected contractors from liability for the use of a product that was designed pursuant to a government contract. The shift of some discretionary decision-making power over product features and characteristics to the contractor from the government, however, may be a cause for concern - particularly if a contractor uses a commercial-off-the-shelf item or an uprated component. This article reviews the government contractor defense and propositions for extending it. It addresses the history, rationale, and the elements of the defense; the application of the defense to nonmilitary contractors; commercial practices, commercial items, and uprating; and suggestions on how to maintain the defense as a viable option.",223537748, 01740099,,Scholarly Journals,,"Maffei, Rocco J;Richter, Jason J", NCMJB9, Department of Defense, Copyright National Contract Management Association 1998,,, PERIODICAL,, 1998, Contractor,,1045-1668,1.0, English, English,, 1-14, Arlington,1998,National Contract Management Journal,1998,,29.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/cots-uprating-government-contractor-defense/docview/223537748/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=COTS--uprating+and+the+government+contractor+defense&amp;title=National+Contract+Management+Journal&amp;issn=10451668&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Maffei%2C+Rocco+J%3BRichter%2C+Jason+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=National+Contract+Management+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/01740099&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,recently congress encouraged agency adopt procurement practice utilize commercial item response revised acquisition procedure reflect commercial practice government contractor historically protected contractor liability use product designed pursuant government contract shift discretionary power product feature characteristic contractor government however may cause concern particularly contractor us item uprated component article review government contractor proposition extending address history rationale element application nonmilitary contractor commercial practice commercial item uprating suggestion maintain viable option,"['recently', 'congress', 'encouraged', 'agencies', 'adopt', 'procurement', 'practices', 'utilize', 'commercial', 'items', 'response', 'revised', 'acquisition', 'procedures', 'reflect', 'commercial', 'practices', 'government', 'contractor', 'historically', 'protected', 'contractors', 'liability', 'use', 'product', 'designed', 'pursuant', 'government', 'contract', 'shift', 'discretionary', 'power', 'product', 'features', 'characteristics', 'contractor', 'government', 'however', 'may', 'cause', 'concern', 'particularly', 'contractor', 'uses', 'item', 'uprated', 'component', 'article', 'reviews', 'government', 'contractor', 'propositions', 'extending', 'addresses', 'history', 'rationale', 'elements', 'application', 'nonmilitary', 'contractors', 'commercial', 'practices', 'commercial', 'items', 'uprating', 'suggestions', 'maintain', 'viable', 'option']",PERIODICAL,2,Management and Leadership

Intelligent agents applied to software management,"Intelligent Agents (IAs) are an area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has recently attracted the attention of many researchers. In this research, three IAs were applied to Software Management. An IA uses a set of rules to determine the best action to take according to the inputs received. To implement the rules for the three agents two things are needed: First, a set of software metrics, and second, for each metric, ranges of admissible values (minimum, average, and maximum). The set of metrics used by the IAs were selected from the following sources: Software Engineering Institute (SEI); IEEE; Army; Department of Defense; and PAMPA. To find ranges of admissible values for the metrics in the set, three databases containing data from past software projects were analyzed. The first was the National Software and Information Repository (NSDIR) sponsored by the Air Force; the second was the Data Analysis Center for Software (DACS) sponsored by the Department of Defense; and the third was the Software Engineering Laboratory (NASA - SEL) sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/ Goddard Space Flight Center NASA/GSFC. In addition, a Software Engineering student project developed at Texas A&amp;M University was measured and analyzed. The first IA is used to estimate the phase of a project. The second IA is used to estimate the effort, development time, staff, paperwork, and number of defects in a software product. The third IA is used to diagnose problems in software products. The IAs will give a warning to software managers if they detect that a metric is out of the admissible range of values. Hopefully, this warning will lead to actions that solve problems before they grow and endanger the software project.",304446220,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Garcia Espinosa, Mario Alberto",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 1997, Applied sciences, 978-0-591-50022-6,,, English, English,,,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/intelligent-agents-applied-software-management/docview/304446220/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Intelligent+agents+applied+to+software+management&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Garcia+Espinosa%2C+Mario+Alberto&amp;isbn=978-0-591-50022-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,intelligent agent ia area artificial intelligence recently attracted attention many researcher three ia applied software management us set rule determine best action take according input received implement rule three agent two thing needed first set software metric second metric range admissible value minimum average maximum set metric used ia selected following source software engineering institute sei ieee army pampa find range admissible value metric set three database containing past software project analyzed first national software information repository nsdir sponsored air force second center software dacs sponsored third software engineering laboratory nasa sel sponsored national aeronautics space goddard space flight center addition software engineering student project developed texas amp measured analyzed first used estimate phase project second used estimate effort development time staff paperwork number defect software product third used diagnose problem software product ia give warning software manager detect metric admissible range value hopefully warning lead action solve problem grow endanger software project,"['intelligent', 'agents', 'ias', 'area', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'recently', 'attracted', 'attention', 'many', 'researchers', 'three', 'ias', 'applied', 'software', 'management', 'uses', 'set', 'rules', 'determine', 'best', 'action', 'take', 'according', 'inputs', 'received', 'implement', 'rules', 'three', 'agents', 'two', 'things', 'needed', 'first', 'set', 'software', 'metrics', 'second', 'metric', 'ranges', 'admissible', 'values', 'minimum', 'average', 'maximum', 'set', 'metrics', 'used', 'ias', 'selected', 'following', 'sources', 'software', 'engineering', 'institute', 'sei', 'ieee', 'army', 'pampa', 'find', 'ranges', 'admissible', 'values', 'metrics', 'set', 'three', 'databases', 'containing', 'data', 'past', 'software', 'projects', 'analyzed', 'first', 'national', 'software', 'information', 'repository', 'nsdir', 'sponsored', 'air', 'force', 'second', 'data', 'center', 'software', 'dacs', 'sponsored', 'third', 'software', 'engineering', 'laboratory', 'nasa', 'sel', 'sponsored', 'national', 'aeronautics', 'space', 'goddard', 'space', 'flight', 'center', 'addition', 'software', 'engineering', 'student', 'project', 'developed', 'texas', 'amp', 'university', 'measured', 'analyzed', 'first', 'used', 'estimate', 'phase', 'project', 'second', 'used', 'estimate', 'effort', 'development', 'time', 'staff', 'paperwork', 'number', 'defects', 'software', 'product', 'third', 'used', 'diagnose', 'problems', 'software', 'products', 'ias', 'give', 'warning', 'software', 'managers', 'detect', 'metric', 'admissible', 'range', 'values', 'hopefully', 'warning', 'lead', 'actions', 'solve', 'problems', 'grow', 'endanger', 'software', 'project']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Continuous Learning
Environmental construction and TQL: A study of the relationship between the United States Navy environmental construction and Total Quality Leadership programs,"The relationship between the United States Navy's Total Quality Leadership (TQL) Program and the administration and management of its environmental construction projects was studied in this research. Specifically, the goal of this research was to quantify the impact of the TQL program. This research studied if the time and effort used in performing TQL techniques in managing these projects is justified. A literature survey was conducted regarding Dr. W. Edwards Deming and his teachings, especially his Total Quality Management (TQM) philosophy, which is the basis for the U.S. Navy's TQL Program. Also surveyed was the U.S. Navy's TQL Program itself, as well as the Department of Defense and U.S. Navy Environmental programs. To quantify the impact of TQL, an analysis was made comparing data collected on environmental construction projects contracted by the U.S. Navy. The comparison was made between selected variables from the construction phase of projects that did use TQL techniques and projects that did not. The variables chosen for study are the three major constraining resources that the U.S. Navy provides for the execution of an environmental construction project: money, time, and effort. To study these variables, data were collected from U.S. Navy environmental construction projects with an emphasis on contract costs, contract durations, and level of government effort or total man-hours of government employees administering the contracts. There were complete data collected on 21 projects that used TQL techniques and 19 projects that did not. The analysis of these data was the basis for the attempt to quantify the impact of the TQL program. The data collected were also used to construct a computer simulation model using the SLAM II simulation language. The simulation model is useful in demonstrating the differences between the two types of projects, and it can be used as an aid to future research. The analysis of the data collected could not conclude that there was a significant difference between projects using TQL techniques (TQLY projects) and projects that did not use TQL techniques (TQLN projects) with regard to contract costs and government effort.

Quality Air Force: Attitudes of managers within an Air Force Air Logistics engine production division,"The purpose of this study was to determine if the attitudes of the lower, middle, and upper levels of management in the Engine Production Division of the United States Air Force Air Logistics Center at Kelly Air Force Base differed in respect to Quality Air Force. In order to answer this question, an instrument developed by the Department of the Navy and titled ""Total Quality Leadership Climate Survey"" was utilized as the primary data collection mechanism. The researcher revised the survey to reflect Air Force terminology and administered it to 143 managers at three target levels. The findings of this study revealed that the attitudes of the managers were different in some cases, but they were favorable for the time frame within which the study was conducted. The viewpoints by managers toward Quality Air Force seemed to be positive and a strength for the organization in eighty-five percent of the areas covered. The managers had significant differing viewpoints in ten percent of the areas where one or more levels of management displayed negative viewpoints. The managers had similar negative viewpoints in five percent of the areas covered. Therefore, various levels of management needed improvement in fifteen percent of the areas covered. The results of this study confirmed the viability and acceptance of Quality Air Force by management officials within the Engine Production Division. It was also recommended that the senior leaders advocate a more active participation by all managers on process improvement teams. This in turn may encourage the delegation of various duties downward to subordinates and eliminate excessive management workloads. It was recommended that research be done to determine if training had a positive effect on management attitudes toward Quality Air Force.

Practical drift: The friendly fire shootdown over northern Iraq,"Dramatic organizational failures and subsequent incident reviews open unique windows into the everyday lives of complex organizations. One such window opened on the 14th of April 1994, when two U.S. Air Force F-15 fighters accidentally shot down two U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters in northern Iraq, killing all twenty-six people on board. After almost two years of extensive investigation, with virtually unlimited resources, no compelling explanation emerged. This thesis explores fundamental behavioral and organizational dynamics that contributed to the shootdown. Individual, group, and organizational links in the causal chain of events are explained by applying a variety of behavioral concepts and theories. Deeper insights come from looking across levels and across time. Grounded theory analysis yielded a dynamic, cross-level mechanism I call ""practical drift""--the slow, steady uncoupling of practice from written procedure. After extended periods of time, locally practical actions within subgroups gradually drift away from originally established procedures. Then, in one of those rare stochastic fits of nature, the system becomes tightly coupled. When drifting sub-units are lurched back into close proximity, the mismatch between locally determined logics of action and globally synchronized rules can be dramatic. In high-hazard organizations, it can be disastrous. Since its inception in 1991, substantial drift crept into Task Force Provide Comfort. Unfortunately, in 1994, a perverse combination of practical drift and situationally-induced tight coupling set the proximate conditions for the shootdown. There are many lessons here. Here is a summary of the most important ones: (1) Look beyond individual error by framing puzzling behavior in complex organizations as individuals struggling to make sense. (2) Follow the basic design principles of high performance teams and think twice about chasing the advantages of social redundancy. (3) Treat organizational states of integration and reliability with chronic suspicion. Recognize them for what they are: constant outcomes of dynamic systems, ongoing accomplishments that require active preventative maintenance. (4) To explain such complex events, move beyond linear, deterministic cause and effect models. Rather than asking what caused the accident, search instead for a general set of conditions that increased the likelihood of failure. (5) Move beyond intra-level accounts and search instead for underlying mechanisms that operate across levels of analysis and across time. (6) Recognize the inadequacy of purely rule-based solutions to address complex dynamic mechanisms such as practical drift. In sum, the fundamental question here is not how to fix pilot misidentification, crew inaction, organizational non-integration, or even practical drift. The more fundamental question raised by this study for both theory and practice is: What are the critical design features of a hyper-complex, multi-level, multi-task, organizational system that increase the likelihood of accomplishing the ""total task"" consistently? As caring humans, we pray that such tragedies never occur. As pragmatic practitioners, we know that they will. As behavioral theorists, we must be ready to rush in and mine them for all they're worth. Building a library of such treasures, thick descriptions of complex untoward events, will move us a long way towards unlocking the fundamental design mysteries of hyper-complex organizations.",304253648,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Snook, Scott Andrew",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,

"Defense, disasters, and drugs: Understanding policy implementation","This study proposes a simplified model to explain the policy implementation process. The author begins by reviewing the main debates being conducted in the scholarly literature on implementation, including debates over perspective, conceptualization, and methods. A main point of criticism of this literature has been a proliferation of independent variables to explain implementation phenomena. In response, the author develops a streamlined model consisting of two key variables: policy content and organizational change. Policy content refers to the history, domain, and theory underpinning a particular approach to solving policy problems. Organizational change refers to changes in practice, mission, and structure that organizations must effect to execute policy mandates. The author then applies this model to three case studies: (1) the long-running effort to improve weapons acquisition in the Department of Defense (DoD); (2) the attempt to build a unified emergency management organization at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and (3) the recent initiative to coordinate federal drug control policy and programs by establishing a drug ""czar"" as Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). Criteria for choosing these agencies as case studies are that each agency exemplifies a distinctive mode of organizational change and manages a policy area that has been the target of a great deal of scrutiny and criticism in recent years. In chapters four through six, the author identifies the key elements of policy history, policy domain, and policy theory characterizing each case study. The basis for this section of the study includes in-depth interviews with key agency officials and reviews of relevant government documents. In chapters seven through nine, the author reviews the organizational change experience of each agency. In this section, the author relies heavily on in-depth interviews with key agency officials. In chapter ten, the author summarizes the key findings of the study and offers some general conclusions about policy implementation.",304235898,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Ferrara, Joseph Andrew",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 1996," Social sciences , Department of Defense , Federal Emergency Management Agency , Office of National Drug Control Policy , organizational change", 978-0-591-01609-3,,, English, English,,,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/defense-disasters-drugs-understanding-policy/docview/304235898/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Defense%2C+disasters%2C+and+drugs%3A+Understanding+policy+implementation&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ferrara%2C+Joseph+Andrew&amp;isbn=978-0-591-01609-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,proposes simplified model explain policy implementation process author begin reviewing main debate conducted scholarly literature implementation including debate perspective conceptualization method main point criticism literature proliferation independent variable explain implementation phenomenon response author develops streamlined model consisting two key variable policy content organizational change policy content refers history domain theory underpinning particular solving policy problem organizational change refers change practice mission structure organization must effect execute policy mandate author applies model three case study effort improve weapon acquisition attempt build unified emergency management organization federal emergency management agency fema recent initiative coordinate federal drug control policy program establishing drug czar director office national drug control policy ondcp criterion choosing agency case study agency exemplifies distinctive mode organizational change manages policy area target great deal scrutiny criticism recent year chapter four six author identifies key element policy history policy domain policy theory characterizing case basis section includes interview key agency official review relevant government document chapter seven nine author review organizational change experience agency section author relies heavily interview key agency official chapter ten author summarizes key finding offer general conclusion policy implementation,"['proposes', 'simplified', 'model', 'explain', 'policy', 'implementation', 'process', 'author', 'begins', 'reviewing', 'main', 'debates', 'conducted', 'scholarly', 'literature', 'implementation', 'including', 'debates', 'perspective', 'conceptualization', 'methods', 'main', 'point', 'criticism', 'literature', 'proliferation', 'independent', 'variables', 'explain', 'implementation', 'phenomena', 'response', 'author', 'develops', 'streamlined', 'model', 'consisting', 'two', 'key', 'variables', 'policy', 'content', 'organizational', 'change', 'policy', 'content', 'refers', 'history', 'domain', 'theory', 'underpinning', 'particular', 'solving', 'policy', 'problems', 'organizational', 'change', 'refers', 'changes', 'practice', 'mission', 'structure', 'organizations', 'must', 'effect', 'execute', 'policy', 'mandates', 'author', 'applies', 'model', 'three', 'case', 'studies', 'effort', 'improve', 'weapons', 'acquisition', 'attempt', 'build', 'unified', 'emergency', 'management', 'organization', 'federal', 'emergency', 'management', 'agency', 'fema', 'recent', 'initiative', 'coordinate', 'federal', 'drug', 'control', 'policy', 'programs', 'establishing', 'drug', 'czar', 'director', 'office', 'national', 'drug', 'control', 'policy', 'ondcp', 'criteria', 'choosing', 'agencies', 'case', 'studies', 'agency', 'exemplifies', 'distinctive', 'mode', 'organizational', 'change', 'manages', 'policy', 'area', 'target', 'great', 'deal', 'scrutiny', 'criticism', 'recent', 'years', 'chapters', 'four', 'six', 'author', 'identifies', 'key', 'elements', 'policy', 'history', 'policy', 'domain', 'policy', 'theory', 'characterizing', 'case', 'basis', 'section', 'includes', 'interviews', 'key', 'agency', 'officials', 'reviews', 'relevant', 'government', 'documents', 'chapters', 'seven', 'nine', 'author', 'reviews', 'organizational', 'change', 'experience', 'agency', 'section', 'author', 'relies', 'heavily', 'interviews', 'key', 'agency', 'officials', 'chapter', 'ten', 'author', 'summarizes', 'key', 'findings', 'offers', 'general', 'conclusions', 'policy', 'implementation']",Dissertation/Thesis,0,Management and Leadership
Achieving breakthrough improvement through business process reengineering,"The Department of Defense's (DoD) Business Process Reengineering (BPR) Support Program was launched in 1991 by the then Deputy Secretary of Defense. The program was developed to apply BPR concepts to the DoD environment. It draws upon proven approaches and techniques, contributes to the growing body of BPR knowledge, and makes expertise, methodology, techniques, and tools available to leaders and project teams charged with process reengineering initiatives. DoD agencies have applied the program's reengineering techniques across a wide range of military, business, and financial functions, completing 148 projects and recommending more than 1,300 major improvements.",194754739, 00565546,,Trade Journals,,"Yeomans, Michael S;Beckett, Janice L", AFCMAF, Department of Defense, Copyright American Society of Military Comptrollers Winter 1996,,, PERIODICAL,, Winter 1996," Process , Business process , Business process re-engineering , Process engineering , Reengineering",,0004-2188,1.0, English, English,, 7, Alexandria,Winter 1996,The Armed Forces Comptroller,1996,,41.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/achieving-breakthrough-improvement-through/docview/194754739/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aaccounting&amp;atitle=Achieving+breakthrough+improvement+through+business+process+reengineering&amp;title=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;issn=00042188&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=41&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=7&amp;au=Yeomans%2C+Michael+S%3BBeckett%2C+Janice+L&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Armed+Forces+Comptroller&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/00565546&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Military Database, ProQuest One Academic",business process reengineering bpr support program launched deputy secretary program developed apply bpr concept environment draw upon proven approach technique contributes growing body bpr knowledge make expertise technique tool available leader project team charged process reengineering initiative agency applied program reengineering technique across wide range business financial function completing project recommending major improvement,"['business', 'process', 'reengineering', 'bpr', 'support', 'program', 'launched', 'deputy', 'secretary', 'program', 'developed', 'apply', 'bpr', 'concepts', 'environment', 'draws', 'upon', 'proven', 'approaches', 'techniques', 'contributes', 'growing', 'body', 'bpr', 'knowledge', 'makes', 'expertise', 'techniques', 'tools', 'available', 'leaders', 'project', 'teams', 'charged', 'process', 'reengineering', 'initiatives', 'agencies', 'applied', 'program', 'reengineering', 'techniques', 'across', 'wide', 'range', 'business', 'financial', 'functions', 'completing', 'projects', 'recommending', 'major', 'improvements']",PERIODICAL,2,Process Improvement
The effect of alternative business practices on business cost,"This research synthesizes a methodology for quantitatively assessing the effect that changes in business processes can have on business performance. Established theoretical constructs of other researchers provide the foundation. Aspects that facilitate the practical application of the methodology are drawn from accepted techniques in complementary disciplines. The practical aspects are joined with the theoretic constructs to form the research methodology. To demonstrate its applicability to specific situations and utility among varied problems, the methodology was applied to two dissimilar problems. The first problem used actual data. Specifically, the methodology was used to develop a model for the acquisition of military aircraft. This model was derived from official Department of Defense directives. Data were actual cost figures for aircraft purchased by the Air Force, Army, and Navy totaling $238 billion. The model was implemented as a computer simulation. This simulation was used to assess the impact that Congressional appropriation of funds had on the acquisition costs of the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The simulation's expected cost closely agreed with earlier Air Force cost projections. However, the simulation results also yielded confidence intervals for acquisition costs, thereby quantifying the risk associated with expected cost estimates. The second problem was hypothetical. The methodology was used to investigate the effect that concurrent engineering can have on system life-cycle costs. A model of a system life cycle was built using functional models obtained from Air Force research programs and transformed into a computer simulation program. Results obtained from simulations confirmed the hypothesis that the engineering approach used to develop a system (i.e. traditional versus concurrent) does have an effect on system life-cycle cost. A sensitivity analysis revealed great benefit near optimal implementation of concurrent engineering but substantial risk associated with suboptimal implementations. Statistical design of experiment techniques were used to explore the entire state space of concurrent engineering levels on system life-cycle costs. A second order equation for predicting system life-cycle costs was derived from the simulated cost values. With this methodology, decision makers can assess the implications of radical change.",304296430,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Reimann, Michael David",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does

A methodology for the measurement and evaluation of complex system designs,"Most complex systems incorporate hardware, software and humanware elements operating synergistically under conflicting functional and nonfunctional objectives. These systems are usually embedded, mission-critical, performance-critical, real-time, distributed, highly integrated, heterogeneous, cost millions of dollars, and take many years to develop. Examples include space stations, combat vessels and aircraft, nuclear power stations, communication networks, and robotics-based manufacturing. Early system design evaluation is essential to assess a design's potential for satisfying operational and budgetary requirements, since a significant percentage of the system life cycle cost is committed by design decisions made early in the system life cycle. However, at the design decision point, knowledge of technology, the operational environment, the political climate, etc., on which to make technically effective and cost efficient decisions is incomplete. Consequently, early design evaluation approaches are needed which yield credible results in the presence of incomplete knowledge. This dissertation describes a multifaceted methodology for complex system design measurement and evaluation which exploits experience, techniques, and heuristics of technical and operational domain experts. The methodology is computer and knowledge based, and includes indicator-based assessment, visual simulation, the analytic hierarchy process, and fuzzy mathematics. The use of this methodology enables qualitative and quantitative measurement and evaluation of system designs at any level of detail desired. An independent assessment of the methodology by researchers and systems engineering practitioners from the DOD, other federal government agencies, commercial industry, and academia affirmed the methodology to be a useful approach in the measurement and evaluation of complex system designs.",304239807,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Talbert, Michael Lane",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 1995," Applied sciences , fuzzy logic , knowledge-based", 9798641361260,,, English, English,,,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/methodology-measurement-evaluation-complex-system/docview/304239807/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+methodology+for+the+measurement+and+evaluation+of+complex+system+designs&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Talbert%2C+Michael+Lane&amp;isbn=9798641361260&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,complex system incorporate hardware software humanware element operating synergistically conflicting functional nonfunctional objective system usually embedded distributed highly integrated heterogeneous cost million dollar take many year develop example include space station combat vessel aircraft nuclear power station communication network manufacturing early system design evaluation essential assess design potential satisfying operational budgetary requirement since significant percentage system life cycle cost committed design decision made early system life cycle however design decision point knowledge technology operational environment political climate make technically effective cost efficient decision incomplete consequently early design evaluation approach needed yield credible result presence incomplete knowledge describes multifaceted complex system design measurement evaluation exploit experience technique heuristic technical operational domain expert computer knowledge based includes assessment visual simulation analytic hierarchy process fuzzy mathematics use enables qualitative quantitative measurement evaluation system design level detail desired independent assessment researcher system engineering practitioner federal government agency commercial industry academia affirmed useful measurement evaluation complex system design,"['complex', 'systems', 'incorporate', 'hardware', 'software', 'humanware', 'elements', 'operating', 'synergistically', 'conflicting', 'functional', 'nonfunctional', 'objectives', 'systems', 'usually', 'embedded', 'distributed', 'highly', 'integrated', 'heterogeneous', 'cost', 'millions', 'dollars', 'take', 'many', 'years', 'develop', 'examples', 'include', 'space', 'stations', 'combat', 'vessels', 'aircraft', 'nuclear', 'power', 'stations', 'communication', 'networks', 'manufacturing', 'early', 'system', 'design', 'evaluation', 'essential', 'assess', 'design', 'potential', 'satisfying', 'operational', 'budgetary', 'requirements', 'since', 'significant', 'percentage', 'system', 'life', 'cycle', 'cost', 'committed', 'design', 'decisions', 'made', 'early', 'system', 'life', 'cycle', 'however', 'design', 'decision', 'point', 'knowledge', 'technology', 'operational', 'environment', 'political', 'climate', 'make', 'technically', 'effective', 'cost', 'efficient', 'decisions', 'incomplete', 'consequently', 'early', 'design', 'evaluation', 'approaches', 'needed', 'yield', 'credible', 'results', 'presence', 'incomplete', 'knowledge', 'dissertation', 'describes', 'multifaceted', 'complex', 'system', 'design', 'measurement', 'evaluation', 'exploits', 'experience', 'techniques', 'heuristics', 'technical', 'operational', 'domain', 'experts', 'computer', 'knowledge', 'based', 'includes', 'assessment', 'visual', 'simulation', 'analytic', 'hierarchy', 'process', 'fuzzy', 'mathematics', 'use', 'enables', 'qualitative', 'quantitative', 'measurement', 'evaluation', 'system', 'designs', 'level', 'detail', 'desired', 'independent', 'assessment', 'researchers', 'systems', 'engineering', 'practitioners', 'federal', 'government', 'agencies', 'commercial', 'industry', 'academia', 'affirmed', 'useful', 'measurement', 'evaluation', 'complex', 'system', 'designs']",Dissertation/Thesis,1,Process Improvement
The impact of work force reductions on those who remain: A study of civilian workers at two Department of Defense bases,"This is a study of the impact of work force reductions on those who remain in the organization within the Department of Defense civilian work force. Research was conducted at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The study arrangement is conceptualized as a collaborative consulting relationship, with the twin purposes of contributing to the research literature on the effects of downsizing and providing valid and useful information to the client. The intended audience for the study is the community of scholars and practitioners who are interested in the practical effects of downsizing on those who remain. The literature review proposes an heuristic framework for analyzing the disparate and disjointed literature on downsizing. Levels of analysis include: (1) organizational (strategy, policy); (2) organizational/individual interface (impact of thoughts and feelings of individuals on organizational functioning); (3) individual (job loss/coping mechanisms); (4) societal; and (5) coalition/industry. The research design replicates and extends the data-collection methodology developed in a referenced study. In total, 26 structured group interviews and 12 structured individual interviews were conducted at the two study sites. With noted exceptions, study participants were randomly selected from representative components of the organization. The interview transcriptions were content analyzed and coded by category of analysis. A follow-up survey, designed to cross-check responses given in interviews, was sent to study participants. Study participants reported increased job insecurity, decreased commitment to the organization, and a negative view of their promotion potential in the organization relative to the time period prior to the work force reductions. The participants did not speak with one voice, however; differences were described in the analysis. For example, at one study site, issues of fairness were far more salient to blue-collar respondents than to white-collar respondents. Among the policy implications of the study: the negative impact of the ""bump and retreat"" systems of work force reduction; the centrality of frank and timely communications; the need to rethink traditional career development strategies; and the need to ""destigmatize"" movement in and out of organizations.

The US military is the single largest purchasing organization in the world and buys $170 billion worth of equipment, parts, and other items each year. Realizing development and acquisition procedures were outdated, and seeing examples of private industry's success, the Department of Defense (DoD) adopted the philosophy of total quality management (TQM) in the late 1980s. The DoD published its Total Quality Management Master Plan in January 1989, outlining the goals and milestones for TQM implementation. After the superb performance of its equipment during the Persian Gulf War, the military's current task is to keep its technological and qualitative edge while facing resource restrictions in funding and personnel. Product and process quality are absolutely imperative to maximize scarce resources and produce reliable, effective, quality equipment, which will save lives during the Army's numerous missions.",231424234, 00947612,,Trade Journals,,"Nagel, James R", IDLEB9, Department of Defense," Copyright Institute of Industrial Engineers, Inc.

Benchmarking data processing installations,"Part of the US Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA) support to corporate information management is the demonstration of techniques which bring about superior information technology performance. As part of this effort, DISA conducted a pilot project to demonstrate the utility of competitive benchmarking of the Department of Defense's data processing installations (DPI) against commercial DPIs. Four vendors were used in the pilot project: 1. Real Decisions Corp., 2. Nolan, Norton &amp; Co., 3. Compass America, and 4. KPMG Peat Marwick. The approach taken by vendors reflects basic differences in focus and purpose. Selection of a vendor should depend on the management style favored by the DPI or the business question leading to the study.

Information processes and shared decision-making: A case study of work teams in a university support service implementing Total Quality Management,"This exploratory case study attempts to answer initial questions about information processes, decision-making, and communication flow in a team-based university environment implementing Total Quality Management (TQM). Specifically, this study focused on the nine information processes found in any living system, as identified by Miller (1978), and their relationship with employee perceptions and opinions of key organizational dimensions. The study was based on Ruscoe's analysis of information processes in U.S. Army battalions (1982, 1985) and his finding that three information processes (monitoring, relating, and deciding) are critical for organizational effectiveness. The working hypothesis was that information processes are directly associated with employee satisfaction and that, the better the communication flow and use of information processes, the greater the employee satisfaction with decision-making, teamwork, and the overall job. Data for the research were collected through organizational surveys (using a questionnaire developed by the researcher) of the 200 employees in an information technology division of a large midwestern, research university. The case study, incorporating an embedded design studied the 13 work teams within the division. The study found that each of the three critical information processes identified by Ruscoe (1982, 1992) was related to higher favorable responses concerning the four key work dimensions analyzed by this case study (communication flow, decision-making, job satisfaction, and teamwork). The relating process seemed to have the most effect on all four indices; when employees in a TQM environment are involved with pulling together information to recommend change, a positive, dependent relationship is seen with communication flow, decision-making practices, job satisfaction, and teamwork. Communication flow and decision-making practices were found to have a relatively strong positive correlation. In those teams that most improved their communication flow processes, employees were more satisfied with decision-making practices, overall job satisfaction, and teamwork. Based on respondent comments between the two surveys, employees seemed less satisfied with interteam communication and more satisfied with improvements in intrateam communication. The research should guide administrators to understand the outcomes of TQM implementation, the conditions that may be needed to assure its success, and that the shift to shared decision-making requires developing good communication flow and building interteam communication channels.",304132188,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Buchanan, Holly Shipp",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest

"Organizational learning in the development of doctrine in the United States Army, 1976-1986: A historically based study","This study used historical research methods to determine the organizational learning dynamics of an organization learning a new conceptual method to accomplish its mission. Specifically, this study examined the organizational learning dynamics of the U.S. Army in the formation and implementation of AirLand Battle doctrine from 1976 to 1986. This timeframe covered the six year development period prior to the publication of the 1982 Army Field Manual (FM) 100-5, Operations., the Army's primary doctrinal manual, and the four year implementation period until the next revision of the manual. The primary historical method used was to develop a narrative of events using official Army documents and secondary historical sources. The historical data within the narrative then was applied to two models to determine whether or not the learning was effective and whether or not learning actually occurred. The Kaufman (1992) Organizational Elements Model (inputs and processes, which produce, in sequence, products, outputs, and outcomes) was used to help determine if effective learning occurred. The Dixon (1992) Organizational Learning Model (information acquisition, information distribution and interpretation, making meaning, organizational memory, and information retrieval) was used to help determine if organizational learning occurred. The study suggested that the Army did learn effectively when the historical information was applied to the Kaufman (1992) model. Army performance in operational tests and simulations after publication of AirLand Battle doctrine, plus the performance in Operation Desert Storm, were effective outputs of the U.S. Army. The study further suggested that the Army did learn when the historical data was applied to the Dixon (1992) model. The U.S. Army had learning activities associated with each major element and subprocess of the model. The study recommends that further research is required in information distribution, organizational memory, and the making meaning elements of the Dixon (1992) model. Within the information retrieval element, further research into the application of fuzzy logic and other computer-aided information retrieval systems is recommended. The implication from this study for the Human Resource Development (HRD) field is that organizational learning suggests a new area for supporting organizational performance. However, HRD practitioners require new knowledge and skills to facilitate organizational learning.",304105637,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Blankenhagen, Edward Elmer",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

The business engineering management implementation process: An approach for unifying the business process reengineering and information engineering disciplines,"During the past 12 years, the author has devoted most of his professional career and much of his personal time to: (1) evaluating and developing methodologies, procedures, and tools for improving and integrating business functions, and (2) using them in real operating organizations--first in the Army Corps of Engineers and then across all Department of Defense functions and components through the Office of the Secretary of Defense. This thesis documents his contributions and puts them in context with the work of the leading theorists and practitioners of this evolving management science. It makes the case that a new ""unified management framework"" is needed for managing business process reengineering and information engineering as a single integrated discipline. It describes the new framework, what it is designed to achieve, its expected payoffs, and what happens if management decides to do nothing.",231299602,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Yoemans, Michael S.",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 1994," Communication and the arts , Social sciences", 979-8-206-47840-2,,, English, English,,,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/business-engineering-management-implementation/docview/231299602/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+business+engineering+management+implementation+process%3A+An+approach+for+unifying+the+business+process+reengineering+and+information+engineering+disciplines&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yoemans%2C+Michael+S.&amp;isbn=979-8-206-47840-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,past year author devoted professional career much personal time evaluating developing methodology procedure tool improving integrating business function using real operating organization first army corp engineer across function component office secretary document contribution put context work leading theorist practitioner evolving management science make case new unified management framework needed managing business process reengineering information engineering single integrated discipline describes new framework designed achieve expected payoff happens management decides nothing,"['past', 'years', 'author', 'devoted', 'professional', 'career', 'much', 'personal', 'time', 'evaluating', 'developing', 'methodologies', 'procedures', 'tools', 'improving', 'integrating', 'business', 'functions', 'using', 'real', 'operating', 'organizations', 'first', 'army', 'corps', 'engineers', 'across', 'functions', 'components', 'office', 'secretary', 'thesis', 'documents', 'contributions', 'puts', 'context', 'work', 'leading', 'theorists', 'practitioners', 'evolving', 'management', 'science', 'makes', 'case', 'new', 'unified', 'management', 'framework', 'needed', 'managing', 'business', 'process', 'reengineering', 'information', 'engineering', 'single', 'integrated', 'discipline', 'describes', 'new', 'framework', 'designed', 'achieve', 'expected', 'payoffs', 'happens', 'management', 'decides', 'nothing']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Process Improvement
An evaluation of the implementation of Total Quality Management in a service organization,"This research consists of a formative evaluation designed to identify the steps necessary to revitalize a formerly successful Total Quality Management (TQM) process at a U.S. Navy engineering and logistics support organization. The research also developed a methodology to account for the fact that the investigator is a well-informed insider who served as one of the principle change agents for the TQM implementation. The research is based on the researcher's observation that the major cause for the waning implementation was due to senior management and leadership issues and the organization-wide processes with which they interface. The investigation consisted of an extensive review of the literature to identify, from a leadership perspective and theory framework, an ideal implementation for this organization. Then a case study was conducted to identify the espoused and actual implementation processes, again from a leadership viewpoint. The gaps or differences between ideal and espoused and espoused and actual were analyzed to identify conditions and relationships which must be addressed as part of the formative evaluation. Significant concerns were identified in leadership actions, TQM processes, allocation of assets and cultural issues which hindered the adoption of the principles of TQM. Each of these was addressed by the development of specific recommendations which, if followed, would result in actions to revitalize the implementation of TQM. The research recognized that much of the discovery and mutually agreed understanding of the incidences associated with TQM had occurred during the actual implementation. The challenge was to develop methods of obtaining validity and insure a true mutual agreement on the occurrences in a manner to satisfy academic standards. This was accomplished through multiple techniques involving the researcher making statements which he believed accurate, frequently in writing, and then either finding substantiating documentation in the historical records or having multiple other insiders ""correct"" the understanding, either through interview or in writing response. This formed a method of ""mutual mirroring"" which insured multiple viewpoints and shared understanding. This research developed a systematic revitalization process which may have application to other similar organizations and improved methods of implementing TQM, especially for planning and developing improvements in quality of daily work. The literature research provided an improved integration of TQM principles with the underlying theories of organizational change and leadership. Specific leadership actions to implement TQM were identified.",304096147,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Stevens, Charles Stanford",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in

Texas Instruments Defense Systems & Electronics Group,"Texas Instruments' Defense Systems &amp; Electronics Group (TI-DSEG) was awarded a 1992 Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in the category of manufacturing companies. TI-DSEG designs and manufactures advanced defense systems and electronics technology for the Department of Defense. The company believes its full-scale total quality management is making it a stronger competitor, one up to building market share in a downsizing defense industry. Aiming to achieve 6-sigma quality by 1995 and reduce product development time by 25% each year, TI-DESG is reaping the benefits of accelerating quality improvement efforts that began in the early 1980s. Effective strategic planning, the use of concurrent engineering methods, and strong relationships with key suppliers have helped the company penetrate new defense markets while increasing its share in 5 of its 6 existing markets.",235204485, 00688783,,Scholarly Journals,,, QULTDP, Texas Instruments Defense Systems & Electronics Group, Copyright Hitchcock Publishing Company Jan 1993,,, PERIODICAL,, Jan 1993," Electronics , Defense Systems , Quality management , Manufacturing , Strategic planning",,0360-9936,1.0, English, English,, 26, Troy,Jan 1993,Quality,1993,,32.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/texas-instruments-defense-systems-amp-electronics/docview/235204485/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Texas+Instruments+Defense+Systems+%26amp%3B+Electronics+Group&amp;title=Quality&amp;issn=03609936&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=32&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=26&amp;au=&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Quality&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/00688783&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Entrepreneurship Collection, Health Research Premium Collection, ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",texas instrument system amp electronics group awarded malcolm baldrige national quality award category manufacturing company design manufacture advanced system electronics technology company belief total quality management making stronger competitor one building market share downsizing industry aiming achieve quality reduce product development time year reaping benefit accelerating quality improvement effort began early effective strategic planning use concurrent engineering method strong relationship key supplier helped company penetrate new market increasing share existing market,"['texas', 'instruments', 'systems', 'amp', 'electronics', 'group', 'awarded', 'malcolm', 'baldrige', 'national', 'quality', 'award', 'category', 'manufacturing', 'companies', 'designs', 'manufactures', 'advanced', 'systems', 'electronics', 'technology', 'company', 'believes', 'total', 'quality', 'management', 'making', 'stronger', 'competitor', 'one', 'building', 'market', 'share', 'downsizing', 'industry', 'aiming', 'achieve', 'quality', 'reduce', 'product', 'development', 'time', 'year', 'reaping', 'benefits', 'accelerating', 'quality', 'improvement', 'efforts', 'began', 'early', 'effective', 'strategic', 'planning', 'use', 'concurrent', 'engineering', 'methods', 'strong', 'relationships', 'key', 'suppliers', 'helped', 'company', 'penetrate', 'new', 'markets', 'increasing', 'share', 'existing', 'markets']",PERIODICAL,1,Process Improvement
A risk management process for Department of Defense acquisition programs operating in an integrated product development environment,"In the past few years Department of Defense acquisition programs have received increased scrutiny from Congress and the general public. Many weapon system programs have had significant cost overruns and schedule delays. The DOD has identified a major cause as being inadequate risk management processes. To improve the existing risk management process, key requirements were determined. The process must be systematic and comprehensive, incorporate proactive management approaches, and emphasize disciplined communication. Finally, the process must be consistent with the concepts of Integrated Product Development being adopted by the DOD. A six step process for risk management is introduced, consisting of risk planning, identification, assessment, analysis, reduction, and monitoring. The concept of integrated product teams creates the backbone of the Integrated Product Development concept, and emphasizes a team approach throughout product development. Incorporating the concepts of Integrated Product Development into the risk management process ensures the key requirements are effectively met.",230806900,,,Dissertations & Theses,,"Draves, Joseph Paul",,, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,, Dissertation/Thesis,, 1993, Applied sciences, 979-8-206-47654-5,,, English, English,,,,1993,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1993,,,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/risk-management-process-department-defense/docview/230806900/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+risk+management+process+for+Department+of+Defense+acquisition+programs+operating+in+an+integrated+product+development+environment&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Draves%2C+Joseph+Paul&amp;isbn=979-8-206-47654-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest One Academic,past year acquisition program received increased scrutiny congress general public many weapon system program significant cost overrun schedule delay identified major cause inadequate risk management process improve existing risk management process key requirement determined process must systematic comprehensive incorporate proactive management approach emphasize disciplined communication finally process must consistent concept integrated product development adopted six step process risk management introduced consisting risk planning identification assessment reduction monitoring concept integrated product team creates backbone integrated product development concept emphasizes team throughout product development incorporating concept integrated product development risk management process ensures key requirement effectively met,"['past', 'years', 'acquisition', 'programs', 'received', 'increased', 'scrutiny', 'congress', 'general', 'public', 'many', 'weapon', 'system', 'programs', 'significant', 'cost', 'overruns', 'schedule', 'delays', 'identified', 'major', 'cause', 'inadequate', 'risk', 'management', 'processes', 'improve', 'existing', 'risk', 'management', 'process', 'key', 'requirements', 'determined', 'process', 'must', 'systematic', 'comprehensive', 'incorporate', 'proactive', 'management', 'approaches', 'emphasize', 'disciplined', 'communication', 'finally', 'process', 'must', 'consistent', 'concepts', 'integrated', 'product', 'development', 'adopted', 'six', 'step', 'process', 'risk', 'management', 'introduced', 'consisting', 'risk', 'planning', 'identification', 'assessment', 'reduction', 'monitoring', 'concept', 'integrated', 'product', 'teams', 'creates', 'backbone', 'integrated', 'product', 'development', 'concept', 'emphasizes', 'team', 'throughout', 'product', 'development', 'incorporating', 'concepts', 'integrated', 'product', 'development', 'risk', 'management', 'process', 'ensures', 'key', 'requirements', 'effectively', 'met']",Dissertation/Thesis,2,Management and Leadership
Roadblocks to Total Quality Management,"The Department of Defense (DOD) formed a process action team (PAT) in 1989 to focus on problems in implementing total quality management (TQM). The PAT's recommendations included: 1. designing a vendor rating system to assess past performance, pricing, and quality as equal evaluation factors, 2. giving preference to contractors that use TQM, 3. making sure the rewards associated with existing incentive contracts are related more to TQM results, and 4. reducing the ""how-to-do-it"" information in DOD directives, instructions, specifications, and standards provided to government contractors. The TQM relationship between DOD and industry is defined as government and industry working together to create an environment and culture that provide products and services to meet or exceed customer expectations. In an environment of shrinking resources and increasing costs and prices, it is essential that industry produce and the government procure the highest quality, best value products and service.",235201787, 00608938,,Scholarly Journals,,"Doherty, Steve D", QULTDP, Department of Defense, Copyright Hitchcock Publishing Company Apr 1992,,, PERIODICAL,, Apr 1992," Quality management , Management , Total quality management , Quality , Industry , Government",,0360-9936,4.0, English, English,, 62, Troy,Apr 1992,Quality,1992,,31.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/roadblocks-total-quality-management/docview/235201787/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Roadblocks+to+Total+Quality+Management&amp;title=Quality&amp;issn=03609936&amp;date=1992-04-01&amp;volume=31&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=62&amp;au=Doherty%2C+Steve+D&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Quality&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/00608938&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Entrepreneurship Collection, Health Research Premium Collection, ProQuest One Academic, SciTech Premium Collection",formed process action team pat focus problem implementing total quality management tqm pat recommendation included designing vendor rating system assess past performance pricing quality equal evaluation factor giving preference contractor use tqm making sure reward associated existing incentive contract related tqm result reducing information directive instruction specification standard provided government contractor tqm relationship industry defined government industry working together create environment culture provide product service meet exceed customer expectation environment shrinking resource increasing cost price essential industry produce government procure highest quality best value product service,"['formed', 'process', 'action', 'team', 'pat', 'focus', 'problems', 'implementing', 'total', 'quality', 'management', 'tqm', 'pat', 'recommendations', 'included', 'designing', 'vendor', 'rating', 'system', 'assess', 'past', 'performance', 'pricing', 'quality', 'equal', 'evaluation', 'factors', 'giving', 'preference', 'contractors', 'use', 'tqm', 'making', 'sure', 'rewards', 'associated', 'existing', 'incentive', 'contracts', 'related', 'tqm', 'results', 'reducing', 'information', 'directives', 'instructions', 'specifications', 'standards', 'provided', 'government', 'contractors', 'tqm', 'relationship', 'industry', 'defined', 'government', 'industry', 'working', 'together', 'create', 'environment', 'culture', 'provide', 'products', 'services', 'meet', 'exceed', 'customer', 'expectations', 'environment', 'shrinking', 'resources', 'increasing', 'costs', 'prices', 'essential', 'industry', 'produce', 'government', 'procure', 'highest', 'quality', 'best', 'value', 'products', 'service']",PERIODICAL,2,Process Improvement

Making Government 'Profitable',"A 1988 Executive Order mandated a program to improve the quality, timeliness, and efficiency of services provided by the federal government. A study was undertaken to examine financial and related performance measures used by private sector service-oriented organizations and how they could be applied to government operations. The study focused on logistics operations to assess the applicability of both traditional and more recently developed techniques from businesses in an actual government operation, the Department of Defense Depot in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Seven major principles for effective development and use of cost-based financial performance were employed at the depot: 1. Use output-oriented measures. 2. Identify total costs of service delivery. 3. Take an operational view of costs. 4. Use measures relating total costs to outputs. 5. Provide incentives for financial and operating performance. 7. Improve quality and timeliness of service delivery.",229800763," 00599885 , 00344370",,Scholarly Journals,,"Harr, David J;Godfrey, James T", MGACBD,, Copyright Institute of Management Accountants Feb 1992,,, Journal Article,, Feb 1992," Government spending , Punctuality , Efficiency , Quality , Government",,0025-1690,8.0, English, English,, 52, Montvale,Feb 1992,Management Accounting,1992,,73.0,https://login.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/making-government-profitable/docview/229800763/se-2?accountid=7122,,https://utsa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UTXSANT_INST/01UTXSANT_INST:DEFAULT??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Making+Government+%27Profitable%27&amp;title=Management+Accounting&amp;issn=00251690&amp;date=1992-02-01&amp;volume=73&amp;issue=8&amp;spage=52&amp;au=Harr%2C+David+J%3BGodfrey%2C+James+T&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Management+Accounting&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/00599885&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Health Research Premium Collection, ProQuest One Academic",executive order mandated program improve quality timeliness efficiency service provided federal government undertaken examine financial related performance measure used private sector organization could applied government operation focused logistics operation assess applicability traditional recently developed technique business actual government operation depot mechanicsburg pennsylvania seven major principle effective development use financial performance employed depot use measure identify total cost service delivery take operational view cost use measure relating total cost output provide incentive financial operating performance improve quality timeliness service delivery,"['executive', 'order', 'mandated', 'program', 'improve', 'quality', 'timeliness', 'efficiency', 'services', 'provided', 'federal', 'government', 'undertaken', 'examine', 'financial', 'related', 'performance', 'measures', 'used', 'private', 'sector', 'organizations', 'could', 'applied', 'government', 'operations', 'focused', 'logistics', 'operations', 'assess', 'applicability', 'traditional', 'recently', 'developed', 'techniques', 'businesses', 'actual', 'government', 'operation', 'depot', 'mechanicsburg', 'pennsylvania', 'seven', 'major', 'principles', 'effective', 'development', 'use', 'financial', 'performance', 'employed', 'depot', 'use', 'measures', 'identify', 'total', 'costs', 'service', 'delivery', 'take', 'operational', 'view', 'costs', 'use', 'measures', 'relating', 'total', 'costs', 'outputs', 'provide', 'incentives', 'financial', 'operating', 'performance', 'improve', 'quality', 'timeliness', 'service', 'delivery']",Journal Article,2,Management and Leadership
